Thomas has ranked top 7 at the position in targets, receptions and yardage during each of the past two seasons. He paced the league with 125 receptions last season thanks to an otherworldly 84 percent catch rate. Thanks, in part, to super-accurate Drew Brees, Thomas has posted a catch rate of at least 72 percent during each of his three NFL seasons. Thomas has yet to reach double-digit touchdowns and has never cleared seven end zone targets in a season, but his elite efficiency and hefty target volume in the Saints' high-scoring offense is plenty enough to allow top-end fantasy production. He's a solid first-round target."
13.0,,,Ezekiel Elliott,-7.59,RB,5,DAL,20.59,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"An absolute workhorse since entering the NFL in 2016, Elliott has played just under 90 percent of Dallas' snaps and handled over 80 percent of the carries when active over the past two seasons. That's led to a league-high 868 carries despite Elliott having missed eight games during that span. Elliott's game reached a new level last season as he easily reached career highs in targets (94), receptions (77) and receiving yards (567). Elliott led all backs in touches (381) and was second in scrimmage yards (2,001). His underwhelming usage near the goal line remains a concern (his 10 carries inside the 5 ranked 17th last season). Nonetheless, Elliott is a young, high-end talent set for a ton of volume. With his contract situation resolved, he should be off the board in the top 4 of every draft."
15.0,0.0,0.0416128,Julio Jones,-1.3599999999999994,WR,6,ATL,16.36,0.0,0.019056434,5.167,14.30236754,1.0,0.416375815,31.0,84.26981978,6.0,5.892018894,11.0,9.135324644,1,"Say what you want about Jones' occasional touchdown deficiencies, he arguably has been the league's best wide receiver since entering the league in 2011. Incredibly, Jones' yards per target has ranked inside the top 20 wide receivers all eight seasons of his career. Despite an unlucky 2017 season in the touchdown department (3 TDs, 8.4 OTD), Jones predictably regressed to the mean and found paydirt eight times (8.0 OTD) in 2018. He finished fourth in fantasy points and hasn't finished a season worse than seventh since 2013. Jones is 30, but his game hasn't slipped, and a role that allowed a position-best eight top 10 fantasy weeks in 2018 is unlikely to change. He's a rock solid top 5 fantasy wideout."
31.0,0.0,0.046874879,DeAndre Hopkins,11.7,WR,7,HOU,19.3,0.0,0.020662933,13.875,13.61646254,2.0,0.573273579,111.0,94.08954426,8.0,6.90998444,13.0,10.51518565,1,"Hopkins has been the No. 2 scoring fantasy wide receiver during each of the past two seasons and has finished in the top 4 three of the past four seasons. Hopkins has been a workhorse, ranking no lower than sixth in targets, receptions, yardage, touchdowns and end zone targets during each of the past two seasons. He has topped the position in OTD both seasons. Finally attached to a quality quarterback for a full season, Hopkins caught a career-high 70 percent of his targets in 2018. Hopkins has managed a massive 35 percent target share over the past two seasons. That could drop some with Kenny Stills, Will Fuller V and Keke Coutee in the mix, but Hopkins will still rank at or near the top of the position in the category. The sure-handed 27-year-old remains an elite fantasy asset."
25.0,,,Dalvin Cook,9.34,RB,2,MIN,15.66,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Now two seasons into his NFL career, Cook has made it through only 13 games healthy. Though durability is obviously a concern, volume and efficiency are not. During those 13 weeks, Cook handled 61 percent of the team's designed runs (14.2 per game) and 14 percent of the targets (4.7 per game). He's averaging 4.7 YPC (2.1 YAC) on 207 career attempts. Cook has yet to emerge as a consistent fantasy threat, but did post the seventh-most fantasy points at the position after Week 12 last season, which aligned both with his return to full health and Minnesota's move to a run-first offense. Minnesota is expected to operate a run-heavy scheme in 2019, and Cook has minimal competition for touches. He's a breakout candidate and strong RB2."
11.0,,,Travis Kelce,-5.41,TE,3,KC,16.41,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Kelce set career-high marks in pass routes (530), targets (149), receptions (103), receiving yards (1,336) and touchdowns (10) last season. As incredible as that achievement is, he did this after already leading all tight ends in fantasy points each of the previous two seasons. Since missing his rookie season with a knee injury, Kelce has finished a season no lower than eighth at the position in receptions, no lower than sixth in receiving yards, no lower than 12th in touchdowns and no lower than ninth in yards per target. The three-time No. 1 fantasy tight end handled 26 percent of Kansas City's targets last season and should be in that range again in 2019. The 29-year-old is your top option at the position and worth a look in the second round of your draft."
42.0,,,Christian McCaffrey,22.19,RB,1,CAR,19.81,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"If not for being rested during a meaningless Week 17 game, McCaffrey would've led all backs in fantasy points last season. The Stanford product took his game to a new level in 2018, playing an almost unheard of 97 percent of Carolina's snaps through Week 16. He finished 10th among backs in rushing attempts (219) and was first in targets (124), receptions (107) and receiving yards (867). McCaffrey had at least five receiving touchdowns for the second year in a row. He improved his yards per carry from 3.7 to 5.0 and his catch rate from 73 percent to 86 percent. The 23-year-old does it all and is well worth the early-first-round fantasy investment."
25.0,,,David Johnson,6.699999999999999,RB,8,ARI,18.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Johnson's career has hit a snag since he dominated the fantasy scene in 2016, pacing all backs in snaps, touches, yardage, touchdowns and fantasy points. An injury cost him all but 43 snaps in 2017, and inefficient play in a weak offense limited him to only two top-10 fantasy weeks (24 backs had more) in 2018. Johnson's yards per carry plummeted to 3.64, his YAC to 1.44 (seventh-worst among running backs) and his catch rate to 66 percent (second-worst). On the plus side, Johnson ranked top-five at the position in snaps (714) and touches (308), which allowed him his third top-10 fantasy campaign in four seasons. The 27-year-old workhorse is expected to retain a hefty role in new coach Kliff Kingsbury's offense. An intriguing bounce-back candidate, Johnson is a mid-pack RB1."
17.0,,,Saquon Barkley,-4.809999999999999,RB,29,NYG,21.81,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Barkley was the second overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft and it's fair to say he'll be the first overall pick in most 2019 fantasy drafts. Barkley was a workhorse as a rookie, racking up 261 carries (second-most among running backs) and 119 targets (third-most), while pacing the position in routes (458), scrimmage yards (2,028) and fantasy points (386). Barkley finished worse than 13th at the position in fantasy points in only two weeks. He was on the field for 83 percent of the Giants' snaps, handled 75 percent of the designed runs and took on 21 percent of the targets. That workhorse usage isn't expected to change in what could be an even run-heavier offense in 2019. Barkley is the top asset in fantasy."
10.0,,,Todd Gurley II,-5.699999999999999,RB,18,LAR,15.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"After Gurley was the consensus No. 1 overall pick in 2018 fantasy drafts, his stock is down following an injury-fueled slow finish to the season. Gurley is expected to be fully healthy for 2019, of course, which means you may actually be able to get a discount on a player who scored 21 touchdowns in 14 games last season. The 24-year-old workhorse missed two games but still ranked fourth among backs in snaps, touches and scrimmage yards. He has paced running backs in fantasy points per game and top-10 fantasy weeks each of the past two seasons. Concerns about Gurley's knee remain, which has knocked down his fantasy stock, but his massive fantasy upside makes him a fine choice in Round 2."
27.0,,,Patrick Mahomes,7.77,QB,5,KC,19.23,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"If you took a shot on Mahomes late in your 2018 fantasy draft, congratulations, you probably won your league. Mahomes exploded onto the fantasy scene with 12 top-10 fantasy weeks en route to finishing as the top-scoring QB by 62 points over second-place Matt Ryan. Mahomes paced the league in passing touchdowns (50) and was second in passing yards (5,097), while adding 272 yards and two scores rushing. Entering his third season, Mahomes looks like the next great NFL quarterback -- and should be the top QB off the board in all drafts -- but history suggests we should expect a substantial statistical dip. Daunte Culpepper was the last to repeat as the No. 1 fantasy quarterback, and that was way back in 2003-04."
23.0,,,Alvin Kamara,2.84,RB,11,NO,20.16,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Following as efficient a season as you'll find for any running back (let alone a rookie) in 2017, Kamara's 2018 went about as expected: He regressed to the mean, but still played at a high level and was a terrific fantasy asset. The former third-round pick finished top-eight among backs in snaps (628), touches (275), scrimmage yards (1592), offensive touchdowns (18) and fantasy points (354). Kamara has yet to clear 200 carries in a season, but he has caught 81 passes in both of his NFL seasons and saw a significant uptick in work near the goal line last season (his 14.5 OTD ranked second in the league). Kamara's role won't change much with Latavius Murray added to replace Mark Ingram II. The 23-year-old back remains a solid RB1 option."
10.0,,,Zach Ertz,-2.9800000000000004,TE,6,PHI,12.98,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Ertz set the all-time tight end record with 116 receptions last season and was fantasy's No. 2 scorer at the position. Incredibly, Ertz has improved his fantasy point total each of his seasons in the NFL and has now posted four consecutive top-nine finishes. He paced all tight ends in snaps (949), routes (550) and targets (156), while ranking top-four in receiving yards (1,163), touchdowns (eight) and end-zone targets (nine) last season. After struggling in the area during his first four seasons, Ertz has scored exactly eight touchdowns in back-to-back seasons. The 28-year-old is an elite, high-floor fantasy option who could defer some targets to DeSean Jackson and Dallas Goedert and still post a top-three fantasy season. He'll cost you a third-round pick this season."
3.0,0.0,0.021573988,Tyreek Hill,-12.78,WR,70,KC,15.78,0.0,0.015004306,8.0,14.67483447,0.0,0.480309681,16.0,76.17915708,2.0,5.191142511,2.0,8.143873061,1,"Hill has seen his production increase during each of his NFL seasons. Fantasy's No. 19 scoring receiver as a rookie in 2016, Hill climbed to eighth in 2017 and to first in 2018. Though Hill's usage has progressively increased, he has made his hay with outstanding efficiency. He paced all wide receivers with an 11.5 YPT in 2017 and finished fifth at 10.9 last season. He also has ranked top 12 in YPR and RAC both seasons, while actually reaching a career high 14.7 aDOT last season (eighth highest). The versatile Hill has ranked second among wideouts in carries during each of his three seasons and has added four rushing and five return touchdowns along the way. Hill is a mid-range WR1 with upside to again pace the position in fantasy points."
26.0,0.0,0.041003538,Keenan Allen,10.54,WR,7,LAC,15.46,0.0,0.020090341,15.375,12.47170754,1.0,0.433644369,123.0,73.07640598,8.0,5.859374568,10.0,8.57394581,1,"After missing 26 games (including at least one each season) during his first four NFL seasons, Allen has appeared in all 32 of the Chargers games during the past two regular seasons. In fact, he has been on the field for 91 percent of the team's pass plays and has handled a hefty 28 percent target share. Allen has finished no lower than 13th at the position in targets, receptions, receiving yards and fantasy points during each of the past two seasons. If there's a concern area, it's touchdowns, as Allen hasn't scored more than six in a season since his rookie campaign in 2013. Allen's 5.4 OTD last season suggests he was fortunate to even reach six scores. Allen is in his prime at age 27 and one of the game's most effective receivers. Philip Rivers' top target is a safe back-end WR1."
23.0,,,Le'Veon Bell,8.54,RB,16,NYJ,14.46,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Bell has signed on with the Jets after infamously sitting out the entire 2018 season due to a contract dispute. A longtime NFL workhorse, Bell ranked first among running backs in snaps (3,449), fourth in carries (1,229), third in rushing yards (5,336), fourth in rushing touchdowns (35), first in targets (390) and first in receiving yards (312) from 2013-17 despite missing 18 of 80 possible games. Bell, who has appeared in all 16 regular-season games once in his career, saw his efficiency take a dip in 2017, but pacing the position in rushes and receptions was enough to help him post his third top-three-overall fantasy season in four years. Jets coach Adam Gase's tendency to pass near the goal line (NFL-low 23 carries inside the 5 during his three seasons in Miami) could cost Bell some touchdowns, but the former Steeler won't have trouble generating big volume in an improving offense. He's a solid RB1."
10.0,,,Leonard Fournette,-6.219999999999999,RB,7,JAX,16.22,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Fournette hasn't quite lived up to lofty expectations since being selected fourth overall in the 2017 draft. The 24-year-old back has already missed 11 games and has seen his yards per carry fall from 3.9 in 2017 to 3.3 (fifth-worst) in 2018. Though, in his defense, Fournette has dealt with a large number of stacked boxes and horrific quarterback play. On the plus side, an extensive workload near the goal line (19 carries inside the 5 in 21 games) and good receiving efficiency (82 percent catch rate, 8.4 YPR) have helped him to two straight seasons finishing top-12 in fantasy points per game. Fournette's Trent Richardson-like efficiency woes are a concern, but the addition QB Nick Foles and massive volume he receives keep him in the RB1 discussion and offer hope for a breakout season."
7.0,0.0,0.024791733,Davante Adams,-9.440000000000001,WR,51,GB,16.44,0.0,0.023333275,9.0,11.58724653,0.0,0.492620653,36.0,75.09887503,4.0,6.481166585,8.0,9.763818677,1,"Adams took his game to another level in 2018. In fact, before missing Week 17 because of an injury, Adams was the No. 1 scoring fantasy wide receiver. Incredibly, Adams ranked in the top 18 among wide receivers in all but one week last season (27th in Week 4) aside from the one week he missed. In addition to catching 13 touchdowns (second most), Adams ranked fourth at the position in routes (618), fourth in targets (164), fifth in receptions (111) and sixth in receiving yards (1,386). Adams has hauled in 35 touchdowns over the past three seasons, which trails only Antonio Brown for most in the league. Adams has done this damage despite missing at least one game three of the past four seasons. The 26-year-old soaked up a massive 30 percent target share last season and has little competition for targets again in 2019. He's a fine choice in the middle of the first round."
30.0,,,Deshaun Watson,9.670000000000002,QB,2,HOU,20.33,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Watson picked up where he left off during an injury-shortened rookie season with a terrific sophomore campaign. The Clemson product was fantasy's No. 4 QB and his 10 top-10 fantasy weeks ranked third. Despite dealing with overwhelming pressure due to a weak offensive line (league-high 62 sacks), Watson ranked top 12 in passing yards (4,165) and touchdowns (26). He added 551 yards and five scores on 99 carries, all of which ranked third at the position. Watson is only 23 years old, adds value with his arm and legs, and will have a better and healthier supporting cast in 2019. He's a strong QB1."
11.0,,,Nick Chubb,-5.960000000000001,RB,6,CLE,16.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Chubb opened his NFL career buried behind both Carlos Hyde and Duke Johnson, but it didn't take long for the 2018 second-round pick to force his way into a massive role. Once he took over as the lead back in Week 7, Chubb handled 80 percent of the Browns' designed runs and 10 percent of the targets, and only seven backs scored more fantasy points. For the entire season, Chubb averaged 5.2 YPC (10th-highest at the position), including 2.41 after contact (seventh-best), and he averaged 0.53 fantasy points per snap, which was fourth-highest among backs. Chubb will open 2019 as Cleveland's clear feature back, though a limited role as a receiver and the return of Kareem Hunt around midseason limit his upside a bit. Chubb is best viewed as a strong RB2 in Cleveland's improved offense."
13.0,,,George Kittle,-1.5099999999999998,TE,7,SF,14.51,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"After showing flashes of his massive ceiling as a fifth-round rookie in 2017, Kittle exploded for a tight-end record 1,377 receiving yards last season. The Iowa product also ranked first at the position RAC (9.7) and was third in targets (136), receptions (88), fantasy points (259) and YPR (15.6). The only area where Kittle was truly underwhelming was in the scoring department, as he managed only five touchdowns (5.8 OTD) and seven end-zone targets. The future is bright for the 25-year-old Kittle, who will sustain a massive target share in the 49ers' improving offense. Scoop him up in the third round of your draft."
14.0,0.0,0.025657851,Odell Beckham Jr.,-1.7300000000000004,WR,28,CLE,15.73,0.0,0.03360851,10.143,13.66580475,0.0,0.543648915,71.0,74.08272433,7.0,5.421029035,11.0,8.632415848,1,"Following a tumultuous but highly productive five seasons in New York, Beckham was traded to the Browns during the offseason. After finishing each of his first three NFL seasons with 1,300-plus receiving yards, 10-plus touchdowns and as a top-7 fantasy receiver, Beckham has managed a total of 1,354 yards and nine touchdown receptions while missing 16 of 32 games because of injury during the past two seasons. Though his play came back to earth a bit in 2018, Beckham ranked top 8 at the position in fantasy points per game for the fourth time in five seasons. Baker Mayfield's new No. 1 target is a strong bet to blow by 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth time in six seasons. The 26-year-old is a midpack WR1 with elite upside."
10.0,,,James Conner,-3.92,RB,13,PIT,13.92,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Second-year Conner was abruptly thrown into the fire last season with Le'Veon Bell sitting out the season. Conner picked up where his predecessor left off, handling 81 percent of the team's carries and 13 percent of the targets prior to suffering an injury in Week 13. During those 13 weeks, Conner put up 1,368 scrimmage yards and 13 touchdowns, which helped him to the fifth-most fantasy points among running backs. Conner's efficiency was solid and, unlike Bell, he benefited from getting many carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (15, third-most). With Bell now in New York, the 24-year-old Conner returns as the Steelers' clear feature back. He's a back-end RB1."
22.0,0.0,0.05344655,Amari Cooper,7.83,WR,4,DAL,14.17,0.0,0.023628929,17.667,13.79983235,1.0,0.54181099,106.0,68.21464484,6.0,4.943150259,9.0,7.387559497,1,"Cooper kicked off his career with a pair of 1,000-yard and top 25 fantasy seasons in Oakland, but it took a trade to Dallas last season for him to really take off. Cooper, who handled 21 percent target share in Oakland, had a career-high 25 percent share in 11 games with Dallas. In fact, he never fell below a 16 percent share in a single game and was fantasy's No. 9 wide receiver from Week 9 on. Cooper's boost in volume coincided with improved efficiency (he caught a career-high 71 percent of his targets and averaged a career-best 9.5 YPT), which is enough to make the 25-year-old a strong WR2 with top-10 upside."
13.0,0.0,0.037931865,Adam Thielen,-1.1899999999999995,WR,12,MIN,14.19,0.0,0.020938844,14.333,12.39880734,1.0,0.434116738,43.0,69.09722955,3.0,5.572893237,3.0,7.954313062,1,"Thielen did it again. For the fourth consecutive season, he posted a career high in receptions (113), receiving yards (1,373) and fantasy points (307). Thielen also scored a career-high nine touchdowns, which nearly matched his previous career total of 10. Thielen posted eight top 10 fantasy weeks, which tied for most in the league, though he ended up seventh in fantasy points at season's end after Minnesota switched offensive coordinators and to a run-heavy offense down the stretch. Thielen has never cleared 10 end zone targets in a season, and Mike Zimmer's commitment to establishing the run could limit his upside a bit, but the 28-year-old has proven to be one of the best in the business. He's a strong WR1."
11.0,0.0,0.025352698,Cooper Kupp,-0.6600000000000001,WR,3,LAR,11.66,0.0,0.017885987,6.571,13.34075905,0.0,0.381914418,46.0,57.89275541,7.0,4.33953984,10.0,6.321321049,1,"Kupp has been a solid fantasy asset since being selected in the third round of the 2017 draft, but a pair of injuries derailed what would've been a major breakout in 2018. During the seven full games he played with Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods last season, Kupp handled a solid 22 percent target share (7.3 per game) and ranked eighth in fantasy points. Kupp scored six touchdowns during those seven games (though his 2.7 OTD suggests he was over his head in that department). He also ranked third among receivers with a 77 percent catch rate, fourth with a 10.9 YPT, and second with a 7.6 RAC last season. The 26-year-old has the look of a solid WR2 play."

Tom Brady's top target was limited to one top 10 fantasy week but finished only one of 12 outings worse than 30th, making him the second-safest bet for a top-30 week behind only Davante Adams. Edelman is averaging a massive 9.4 targets per game over the past five seasons and reached eight targets in nine of 12 games in 2018. Durability is the notable drawback as he has missed 45 of 160 possible regular-season games (28 percent) since joining the team in 2009. Edelman is now 33, but following Rob Gronkowski's retirement, he's ticketed for a gigantic offensive role. Consider him a strong WR2 option."

Smith-Schuster should be able to handle it considering he's fresh off arguably the best second season for a second-year wide receiver in league history. Smith-Schuster paced all wide receivers in pass routes (662) and finished no lower than seventh in targets (167), receptions (111) and receiving yards (1,383). Smith-Schuster has scored seven touchdowns during each of his two NFL seasons, though his 8.3 OTD and 13 end zone targets in 2018 suggest he was a bit unlucky in that department. Smith-Schuster's targets might not rise significantly in 2019, but that's only because he was already a huge part of the offense. Incredibly still only 22, Smith-Schuster's best days still could be ahead of him. He's a solid WR1 with upside to lead the position in fantasy points."
14.0,,,Greg Zuerlein,5.15,K,2,LAR,8.85,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"After pacing all kickers in fantasy points in 2017, Zuerlein missed five games in 2018, but still managed an 11th-place finish. Zuerlein was the top-scoring kicker when active and his nine top-10 weeks were two more than the next-closest kicker during those weeks. Incredibly, Zuerlein has produced 10-plus fantasy points in 18 of 27 games during Sean McVay's two seasons as head coach. The primary reason for the success has been volume. The Rams attempted 2.65 field goals per game (second most) in 2017 and 2.68 per game (most) in 2018, which are two of the five highest totals the NFL has seen during the past decade. Zuerlein has made 91.5 percent of his field goals over the past two seasons (fourth best). He is the clear No. 1 fantasy kicker option in 2019."
7.0,,,Patriots D/ST,1.9400000000000004,DST,1,NE,5.06,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"All eyes are usually on the New England offense, but the Patriots' defense has been good for a long time. In fact, their D/ST has posted seven top-10 fantasy campaigns the past nine seasons. New England struggled to only 30 sacks last season (third-fewest) but made up for it with 28 forced turnovers (fifth) and four touchdowns (tied for seventh). The Patriots ranked seventh in points allowed (325) and have ranked top-10 in the category 12 of the past 13 seasons. Fantasy's reigning No. 6 D/ST lost Trey Flowers, Malcom Brown and star returner Cordarrelle Patterson but added Michael Bennett to a core that includes Stephon Gilmore, Devin McCourty and Lawrence Guy. This is an average group on paper, but it is led by a coach who always maximizes his talent. As usual, the Patriots' D/ST is a back-end starting option."
4.0,,,Aaron Jones,-7.26,RB,4,GB,11.26,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"For the second consecutive season, Jones was one of the league's more efficient running backs in 2018, but a limited role and missed games precluded the 2017 fifth-round pick from consistent fantasy production. Jones has missed four games in each of the past two seasons but has averaged a healthy 5.5 YPC during both campaigns. Despite playing only 51 percent of the snaps, Jones posted a trio of top-10 fantasy weeks and ranked 13th at the position in fantasy points during the 11 weeks in which he wasn't out or injured last season. With a new coaching staff in place, Jones is the favorite to lead a committee with Jamaal Williams this season. Jones will be positioned for around 200 carries and a modest receiving role, which should allow for solid RB2 numbers."
32.0,,,Lamar Jackson,14.04,QB,1,BAL,17.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Jackson took ""dual threat"" quarterback to a new level during his rookie season, setting an NFL single-season quarterback record with 147 carries despite starting only seven regular-season games. Jackson averaged a massive 17.0 carries per game and ranked seventh in the entire NFL with 556 rushing yards during his seven starts. Jackson did, however, struggle as a passer. He completed 58 percent of his passes (fourth worst) and was off target on 22 percent of his throws (second worst). The Baltimore offense averaged 1.9 touchdowns per game during Jackson's starts, which would have ranked seventh worst over the full season. Jackson's legs provide him with QB1 upside, but a lack of passing volume and efficiency, coupled with inherent durability concerns makes him more of a QB2 target."
4.0,0.0,0.036610348,Mike Evans,-11.79,WR,15,TB,15.79,0.0,0.020420539,14.0,16.17152193,0.0,0.460390322,28.0,81.80246961,2.0,5.0584274,5.0,8.55868304,1,"Evans has finished no lower than 11th in targets, no lower than 12th in receiving yardage and no lower than eighth in OTD among wide receivers during each of the past four seasons. Despite that consistency, his fantasy output has been inconsistent due to fluctuating touchdown output. After catching 12 touchdowns as a rookie, his totals have been 3, 12, 5 and 8, respectively. Evans was fantasy's No. 9 wideout last season despite a career-low 23 percent target share. Impressively, he caught a career-high 62 percent of his targets despite a career-high 15.7 aDOT. Evans ranked third among receivers in both YPR (17.7) and YPT (11.0) and sits second in the NFL with 88 end zone targets since entering the league. The 6-foot-5 25-year-old is a fringe WR1."
23.0,,,Chris Carson,8.77,RB,9,SEA,14.23,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Seahawks drafted a running back (Rashaad Penny) in the first round of the 2018 draft, but that didn't stop second-year Carson from taking a firm grasp of lead back duties last season. Carson posted 247 carries (seventh-most) for 1,151 yards (fifth-most) and nine scores (seventh-most) in 14 games as the lead back in Seattle's run-heavy offense. Carson averaged 2.29 yards after contact (11th-best) and, though he played a minimal role as a receiver, caught all but three of his 23 targets. Seattle's run-heavy scheme will be back in 2019, and Carson's terrific second season gives him the leg up on Penny for the bulk of the backfield touches. Carson is expected to see a boost in receiving work, as well, so he'll touch the ball more than enough to allow RB2 numbers."
28.0,,,Derrick Henry,14.77,RB,12,TEN,13.23,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"It isn't often that a player has nearly as many rushing touchdowns as he has receptions, but that was the case for Henry last season. The oversized back rushed for 12 scores (third-most) thanks to 13 carries inside the 5 (fourth-most). Despite playing a situational role most of the season, Henry's 238-yard, four-touchdown effort in Week 14 vaulted him into a larger role down the stretch. He was the top-scoring fantasy back by 17 points from that point on. Henry has been very efficient as a rusher (top-three in YAC each of the past two seasons) but has yet to clear 15 receptions in a season. He's expected to take on the largest role of his career in 2019, but that doesn't figure to mean much of an uptick in targets. That limits him to RB2 territory, but upgrade him in non-PPR."
28.0,,,Evan Engram,16.45,TE,5,NYG,11.55,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"A first-round pick back in 2017, Engram has missed six games due to injury but has produced at a high level when he's been healthy. In fact, he's ranked fourth and seventh, respectively, in fantasy points per game during his two seasons. Engram enters his third season positioned for an even larger role after New York traded Odell Beckham to Cleveland. Engram exploded during the four games Beckham missed last season, posting weekly fantasy finishes of 12th, first, fourth and third to finish off the 2018 season. Engram posted a top-10 fantasy week during 45 percent of his 2018 outings, which was sixth-best at the position. He ranked seventh with a 9.2 YPR and third with an 8.6 RAC. Engram is locked into a huge role in his third season and is a midrange TE1."
10.0,,,Bears D/ST,2.55,DST,5,CHI,7.45,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Bears entered the 2018 season with arguably the league's best defense on paper, and boy, did they deliver. Fantasy's top-scoring D/ST (55 points more than second place) paced the NFL in interceptions (27), D/ST touchdowns (six), passes defensed (92) and points allowed (283). They ranked third in sacks with 50. Chicago lost Adrian Amos and Bryce Callahan in free agency but remains stocked with star talent on every level, led by the likes of Akiem Hicks, Khalil Mack, Kyle Fuller, Danny Trevathan and Eddie Jackson. The addition of star returner Cordarrelle Patterson (league-high four kick return touchdowns since 2014) adds to the appeal. This elite unit should be the first off the board in 2019 fantasy drafts."
3.0,,,Joe Mixon,-11.72,RB,33,CIN,14.72,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Mixon appeared in 14 games last season and handled a generous 16.9 carries and 3.9 targets per game. His rushing efficiency took a giant step forward from that of his rookie season, as the 2017 second-round pick boosted his yards per carry from 3.5 to 4.9 and his YAC from 1.7 to 1.9. Mixon quietly ended up fourth at the position in rushing yards (1,168), sixth in both touches (280) and scrimmage yards (1,464), and 10th in fantasy points (243). The Bengals' offensive line remains a problem area, but 22-year-old Mixon is a workhorse back positioned well for another step forward in his third season. Consider him a fringe RB1."
22.0,,,Mark Ingram II,8.4,RB,9,BAL,13.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Ingram joins the Ravens after an eight-year stint in New Orleans. Following a slow start to his career, Ingram has averaged 4.73 YPC, including 2.10 after contact, the past six seasons. Those marks rank first and second, respectively, among 31 backs with 650 carries in that span. Ingram ranks second in the league in rushing touchdowns (39), second in rushing OTD (37.5) and tied for first in carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (61) the past five seasons. The 29-year-old Ingram is a strong bet to pace the extremely run-heavy Ravens' backfield in carries and possibly targets. Ingram has a real shot to eclipse his previous career-high carry total of 230 (2017). He's a flex option who can be upgraded slightly in non-PPR."
28.0,0.0,0.024061949,T.Y.

Hilton has now finished all seven of his NFL seasons as a top 27 fantasy receiver. Hilton, who has missed only four games in his NFL career, averaged 16.7 YPR last season and has ranked above the 80th percentile in the category each of the past five seasons. He has ranked above the 85th percentile in YPR four of the past five seasons. Hilton's main concern area is touchdowns, as he has never managed more than seven scores in a single season and hasn't caught more than six since 2014. Hilton has ranked outside the top 30 wide receivers in end zone targets during each of the past two seasons. Hilton's value takes a hit following Andrew Luck's retirement, especially considering he was held to four touchdowns and a 55 percent catch rate (both career lows) with Jacoby Brissett under center in 2017. Consider Hilton a fringe WR2."
3.0,,,Devonta Freeman,-10.48,RB,16,ATL,13.48,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Freeman enters his sixth NFL season after missing all but 64 snaps due to injury last season. Of course, he posted stellar numbers in each of his previous three seasons. The 2014 fourth-round pick paced the position in fantasy points in 2015, finished sixth in 2016 and ranked ninth in the 13 weeks he was active and healthy in 2017. Freeman's efficiency has been good, but where he really stands out is volume near the goal line. He rushed for 29 touchdowns from 2015 to 2017, thanks to 41 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (second-most). He finished top-five in the category all three seasons and scored six touchdown receptions in that span. Tevin Coleman is gone, which helps solidify the 27-year-old's standing as a solid RB2 with RB1 upside."
15.0,,,Russell Wilson,-1.9800000000000004,QB,2,SEA,16.98,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Wilson paced all quarterbacks in fantasy scoring by 49 points in 2017, but Seattle's move to a run-heavy offense led to a dip all the way to ninth in 2018. Wilson posted eight top-10 outings (fifth most), but failed to clear 29 points in a single week. Wilson's 427 pass attempts ranked 20th and were his fewest since 2013. Wilson is a strong candidate for touchdown regression to the mean (his 8.2 percent TD rate ranks third over the past decade). Offensive line remains a concern after Wilson was sacked on 10.7 percent of his dropbacks (fifth highest). Wilson is extremely efficient and adds value with his legs, but Seattle's commitment to a run-heavy offense limits his fantasy upside. He's a back-end QB1."
14.0,0.0,0.030894879,Kenny Golladay,0.9000000000000004,WR,25,DET,13.1,0.0,0.019954616,10.5,13.94385242,1.0,0.369663178,42.0,68.10873878,4.0,4.884499401,9.0,8.210651912,1,"The Lions turned to a run-first scheme and struggled with efficiency last season, but that didn't stop Golladay from enjoying a breakout season. The 2017 third-round pick exploded for a 70/1063/5 line despite 25 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (15th highest). Golladay was limited to two top 10 fantasy weeks and his touchdown total leaves something to be desired (6.0 OTD), but he still managed to put together a 21st-place finish in fantasy points in 15 games. The 25-year-old is, at least, a fringe WR2 and there's upside for more in his third NFL season."
11.0,,,Justin Tucker,1.8100000000000005,K,1,BAL,9.19,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Tucker was fantasy's No. 2 scoring kicker last season and has now finished no lower than 11th during any of his seven NFL seasons. His 10 top-10 fantasy weeks last season led the NFL. Baltimore's kicker remains one of the best in the business. He connected on 35 of 39 field goal attempts last season (89.7 percent) and has made 38 of 54 attempts (70.4 percent) from 50-plus yards during his career. The 29-year-old is an elite fantasy option.
23.0,,,Josh Jacobs,7.77,RB,15,OAK,15.23,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Oakland has a new feature back after selecting Jacobs with the No. 24 overall pick in April's draft. Jacobs has a solid frame (5-foot-10, 220 pounds) and is a terrific rusher, good receiver and even offers value as a kick returner. The Alabama product lacks top-end speed, but is quick, elusive and strong. Jacobs broke one tackle for every 6.1 touches last season, which was best among backs who attended the combine. Jacobs has the skill set to quickly step in as a three-down back in the pros and, aside from deferring some work to Jalen Richard in passing situations, he figures to play that full-time role right out of the gate. Jacobs shouldn't have trouble pushing for 250 touches as a rookie and should be viewed as an RB2 in season-long leagues."
14.0,0.0,0.040564191,Chris Godwin,2.26,WR,2,TB,11.74,0.0,0.018599803,17.667,13.72079966,1.0,0.419341018,53.0,58.53900913,3.0,4.266442961,6.0,6.846946432,1,"Godwin was limited to 57 percent of the Buccaneers' pass plays last season but still managed a 59/842/7 line and 27th-place finish in fantasy points. The 2017 third-round pick ranked 52nd at the position in routes, but was 25th in receiving yards and 13th in touchdowns thanks to a solid 9.0 YPT and 14 end zone targets (sixth most). Godwin has three drops on 150 career targets and has ranked top 5 in first down rate each of his two NFL seasons. New coach Bruce Arians, whose wide receivers ranked fifth in fantasy points during his five seasons as Arizona's head coach, says he believes Godwin could push for 100 catches in 2019. That might be a stretch, but Godwin is well positioned for a run at a top 20 fantasy season."
11.0,0.0,0.022971165,Tyler Lockett,-0.6199999999999992,WR,9,SEA,11.62,0.0,0.01794335,44.0,14.41904185,1.0,0.401340388,44.0,56.82922662,1.0,3.941262339,2.0,5.362944719,1,"Lockett defied logic last season by posting an absurd 57/965/10 line on only 68 targets. Lockett had posted between 64 and 69 targets during each of his first three NFL seasons but never cleared 51 receptions, 664 yards or six touchdowns. Lockett, who hasn't dropped a pass since 2016, caught 84 percent of his targets (second best), posted a 14.2 YPT (best) and scored on 14.7 percent of his targets (second best). Lockett was fantasy's No. 16 receiver (his first career top 40) despite managing only one weekly finish better than 14th. Needless to say, Lockett's efficiency isn't close to sustainable and that includes touchdowns (he scored 10 times despite a 3.0 OTD and seven end zone targets). Lockett is a very good player but he needs more volume to be more than a WR3/flex option. He figures to get it following Doug Baldwin's retirement."
0.0,,,Melvin Gordon,0.0,RB,63,LAC,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Gordon missed four games last season, but still finished top-10 among running backs in scrimmage yards, offensive touchdowns and fantasy points for the third consecutive season. Gordon maintained a substantial (albeit slightly reduced) share of the team's carries, and saw an uptick to 6.1 targets per game. That helped offset a bizarre drop in usage near the goal line; Gordon carried the ball inside the 5-yard line a total of 31 times during the 2016 and 2017 seasons but only four times in 2018. The goal-line usage is a concern, but Gordon is still in his prime at age 26 and is positioned for 300-plus touches in one of the league's better offenses. That, of course, assumes he reports to the team prior to Week 1. For now, Gordon is only worth a look in the fourth or fifth round."
18.0,,,Matt Ryan,1.4600000000000009,QB,6,ATL,16.54,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Perhaps one of the league's most underrated players, Ryan has ranked ninth or better in completions, passing yards and completion percentage each of the past seven seasons. Last season, Ryan finished second at the position in fantasy points for the second time in three seasons. He will be reunited with offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter. Ryan finished top five in the NFL in passing yards during each of Koetter's previous three seasons with Atlanta (2012-14). Ryan doesn't add much with his legs (though he did add three rushing scores along with 35 passing touchdowns last season), but he's never short on top-end volume and efficiency. Especially with a terrific wide receiver trio and solid offensive line, Ryan is positioned for another top-five fantasy campaign."
12.0,,,Aaron Rodgers,-3.3100000000000005,QB,7,GB,15.31,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Rodgers enters 2019 off a relatively disappointing season in which he was limited to six top-10 fantasy weeks (eight QBs had more). Rodgers pushed the ball down field more (his 8.8 aDOT was ninth highest) and saw his completion percentage plummet to 62 percent and his off-target rate increase to 18 percent (eighth highest). On the plus side, Rodgers threw only two interceptions in 597 attempts. A supporting cast lacking depth and a new coach adds some risk, but Rodgers remains one of the best in the business and should be viewed as a strong QB1 option."
17.0,,,Harrison Butker,8.45,K,5,KC,8.55,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"After finishing seventh at the position in fantasy points in 2017, Butker improved to fifth in his second season. Butker attempted 15 fewer field goals last season, but his 69 extra-point attempts were 16 more than the next-closest kicker. His 89.9 percent field goal conversion rate is seventh best in the league during his two seasons in the league. He's missed only one of 41 attempts under 40 yards. The 24-year-old is one of the league's best young kickers and a strong fantasy option."
7.0,,,Kerryon Johnson,-7.130000000000001,RB,28,DET,14.13,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Johnson was one of the youngest players selected in the 2018 draft, but that didn't stop the Auburn product from making an immediate impact. Despite playing only 51 percent of the snaps, Johnson ranked 14th among running backs in fantasy points prior to suffering a season-ending injury in Week 11. Johnson averaged 5.4 YPC (fifth-best) and caught 84 percent (seventh-best) of his 38 targets. Johnson will defer some touches to C.J. Anderson and PJ Johnson this season, but his averages of 12.5 carries and 4.0 targets per game after Week 1 last season will suffice to allow him RB2 production. Plus, there's room for more if he continues to play at a high level and with Theo Riddick gone. Johnson is a solid RB2 and breakout candidate."
5.0,0.0,0.022890042,Stefon Diggs,-8.17,WR,13,MIN,13.17,0.0,0.021461813,18.5,10.78772469,0.0,0.444959245,37.0,58.6305583,2.0,5.434932757,2.0,7.954313062,1,"Diggs has been a strong fantasy force when healthy, ranking no lower than 14th in fantasy points per game during each of the past three seasons. ""When healthy"" has been the key, however, as Diggs has yet to make it through a full 16-game season, missing nine games in four seasons. Diggs did manage a career-best 10th place fantasy finish last season, however, fueled by top-8 finishes in targets (148), receptions (102) and touchdowns (9). Primarily a short-area target, Diggs' 10.0 YPR was sixth lowest and his 6.9 YPT 16th lowest at the position. Even with Minnesota looking to run more often, the 25-year-old should get enough volume to allow strong WR2 value."
33.0,,,Dak Prescott,12.530000000000001,QB,4,DAL,20.47,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Prescott has finished sixth, 11th and 10th, respectively, in fantasy points during his three NFL seasons. Efficient and consistent, he's finished in the upper-third in completion percentage, has thrown either 22 or 23 touchdowns and has rushed for exactly six touchdowns each of the three seasons. Prescott was limited by 56 sacks last season (second most), but the return of center Travis Frederick should help cut that number down. The 25-year-old gets the job done with his arm, is one of the game's better rushing quarterbacks and has Amari Cooper, second-year Michael Gallup and now Jason Witten and Randall Cobb at his disposal. He's a fringe QB1 option."
25.0,,,Tom Brady,7.27,QB,8,NE,17.73,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Brady has finished no worse than 11th in pass attempts, completions, passing yards and passing touchdowns during nine of the past 10 seasons (the only exception being the 2016 suspension-shortened season). Despite consistently ranking near the top of the league in these key categories, Brady has posted only two fantasy campaigns better than ninth during the past six campaigns. Limited by a switch to a run-heavy scheme, Brady was held to five top-10 fantasy weeks last season (his fewest in the past decade). Adding concern is the retirement of Rob Gronkowski, as the New England offense saw a large dip in touchdowns, passing yards, completion percentage and yards per attempt during the 29 games Gronkowski missed from 2010 to 2018. Brady is still an elite player, but New England's run-first offense limits him to QB2 territory."
38.0,,,Austin Ekeler,23.97,RB,3,LAC,14.03,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Granted, it has been in a situational role behind Melvin Gordon, but Ekeler has been one of the league's most efficient backs since he entered the league as an undrafted free agent in 2017. Ekeler is averaging 5.3 YPC (2.4 YAC) on 153 carries and 7.9 YPT on 86 targets in 30 career games. He ranked fourth in YAC last season and has finished top-six in YPR and YPT in both seasons. He has also ranked top-eight in fantasy points per snap both seasons. The 24-year-old will be on the early-season RB1 radar with Gordon continuing his lengthy holdout and could flirt with standalone value once Gordon does report. Ekeler is a good mid-round target."
16.0,,,Austin Hooper,7.43,TE,1,ATL,8.57,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Hooper doesn't get much hype, but the 2016 third-round pick enjoyed a third-year breakout last season en route to a sixth-place finish in fantasy points. Hooper ranked top five at the position in routes (474) and receptions (71). His 82 percent catch rate was second best among tight ends after he ranked fourth in the category in 2017. Hooper's primary drawback has been a lack of scoring, as he's yet to clear four touchdowns or five end-zone targets in a season. The reliable Hooper will be a full-timer in a good offense again this season and is a sneaky low-ceiling/high-floor fringe TE1."
16.0,0.0,0.025503518,Robert Woods,3.4299999999999997,WR,23,LAR,12.57,0.0,0.013830322,8.75,13.51038437,0.0,0.29531494,70.0,62.89411956,8.0,4.6552428,13.0,7.319424372,1,"Fantasy's reigning No. 11 scoring wide receiver, the sure-handed Woods has averaged a healthy 24 percent target share during his two seasons with the Rams. During the seven full games Woods, Brandin Cooks and Cooper Kupp played together last season, Woods paced the team with a 24 percent share (7.9 per game) and ranked 11th in fantasy points. Woods ranked second among all receivers in snaps (996) and was top 10 in touches (105) and scrimmage yards (1376). The concerns with Woods are touchdowns (he has never cleared six touchdown receptions or eight end zone targets in a season) and durability (he has missed at least two games in four of six NFL seasons). Nonetheless, he's the No. 1 receiver in Sean McVay's high-scoring offense and thus a solid WR1."
10.0,,,Phillip Lindsay,-0.9600000000000009,RB,13,DEN,10.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Lindsay entered the 2018 season as a notable combine snub who signed on with Denver as an undrafted free agent. It didn't take him long to become one of the league's most explosive playmakers. Lindsay averaged 5.4 YPC (sixth-highest) on 192 attempts and finished 13th among backs in fantasy points. Although Lindsay's explosiveness can't be overlooked, there were some red flags. He benefited from 3.82 yards before contact per attempt (second-highest), averaged 1.58 after contact (14th-worst), averaged 5.0 yards per target (sixth-worst) and saw his YPC plummet to 2.6 in his final three games. It's possible that we've already seen Lindsay's ceiling, as he turns 25 years old this summer, but he is set for a significant role along with fellow second-year back Royce Freeman this season. Lindsay figures to return to earth a bit, but he's still in the RB2 discussion."
25.0,,,Marlon Mack,15.17,RB,20,IND,9.83,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"If you blinked, you may have missed it, but Mack scored 10 touchdowns in 12 games during the 2018 season. The 2017 fourth-round pick seemingly struggled as a rookie, averaging 3.85 YPC, but his 2.25 YAC suggested a second-year leap. That was indeed the case, as Mack's YPC jumped to 4.66 and allowed him 908 yards on 195 carries. Mack appears to be an effective NFL rusher, but he has yet to make much of an impact as a receiver. He was held to 26 targets and posted an ugly 65 percent catch rate (second-worst among backs) last season. Andrew Luck's retirement and limited receiving work caps his fantasy ceiling, but Mack will get enough volume to allow fringe RB2 numbers."

He has ranked no lower than 11th in pass routes or 13th in receiving yards during the span. Though he's known for his speed and vertical presence, Cooks has ranked near the top of the position in screens and carries during the past two seasons. He has been about as efficient as you could reasonably expect, ranking no worse than 11th in yards per target each of the past three seasons. During the seven full games Cooks, Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp played together last season, Cooks handled a strong 23 percent target share (7.7 per game) and ranked ninth in fantasy points. The 25-year-old is a solid WR2."
24.0,,,Mark Andrews,15.54,TE,4,BAL,8.46,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Andrews was the second tight end drafted by Baltimore last season, but that didn't stop the Oklahoma product from producing one of the best seasons by a rookie tight end over the past decade. Andrews' 552 receiving yards rank sixth, and his 16.2 YPR, 10.0 YPT and 10.4 aDOT all rank second among rookie tight ends since 2007. Andrews did all that damage despite playing only 35 percent of the snaps. Andrews' future looks bright, but he'll need to find ways to stay on the field with 2018 first-round pick Hayden Hurst and re-signed blocker Nick Boyle also on the roster. Andrews is a fine late-round flier, but Baltimore's run-heavy offense will limit his upside."
11.0,,,Bills D/ST,4.34,DST,8,BUF,6.66,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Bills' defense allowed 4,706 yards last season (second-fewest), intercepted 16 passes (seventh-most) and forced 21 fumbles (second-most), which helped their D/ST to a seventh-place fantasy campaign. Coach Sean McDermott has an incredible knack for creating turnovers. Buffalo has ranked no lower than ninth in that department each of the past two seasons, and Carolina ranked top-10 in each of McDermott's final four seasons as that team's defensive coordinator (2013-16). If there is a weak spot, it is sacks, as Buffalo has ranked outside the top 25 in that area each of the past two seasons. The addition of first-round pick Ed Oliver aside, this defense barely changed in the offseason, which means a core led by Jerry Hughes, Tre'Davious White and second-year Tremaine Edmunds is back in place. Signing impact returner Andre Roberts added to this unit's appeal. This is a solid top-10 D/ST."

In 2017, a massive 28 percent of balls thrown his direction were off target, which led to an ugly 48 percent catch rate. He still posted a 57/789/9 line and finished 21st in fantasy points. In 2018, Jeffery missed three games and was targeted closer to the line of scrimmage more often, which allowed a healthy 71 percent catch rate and 65/840/6 line. Jeffery was fantasy's No. 17 WR after returning in Week 4. The rangy receiver has reached double digits in end zone targets during each of the past six seasons and is the top perimeter option in a strong Eagles' offense. The 29-year-old is a solid WR2."
24.0,,,Carson Wentz,6.140000000000001,QB,10,PHI,17.86,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Wentz came back to earth last season following a breakout 2017 campaign in which he tossed 33 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 13 games prior to tearing his ACL. Wentz, who was third in fantasy points per game in 2017, fell to 17th last season during the 11 weeks he was active. On the plus side, Wentz finished top 15 in yards per attempt for the second season in a row and improved his completion rate from 60 to 70 percent (fourth best). Likely related to his ACL recovery but still notable, Wentz's rushing production plummeted (93 yards on 34 carries). Wentz has the support of a great offensive line and now has DeSean Jackson, JJ Arcega-Whiteside and Jordan Howard in his arsenal. He is best valued as a good QB2, but has huge upside."
1.0,,,Sony Michel,-9.81,RB,19,NE,10.81,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Michel appeared in 13 regular-season games as a rookie and handled a generous 16.1 carries per game. That helped the 2018 first-round pick to a top-15 finish in both carries (209) and rushing yards (931). Michel also racked up 12 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (seventh-most), which helped him accrue six rushing touchdowns. New England called run on an enormous 76 percent of Michel's snaps, which meant he was limited to 11 targets. That crushed his fantasy production, as he managed only five top-20 (two top-10) fantasy weeks. It's possible the 24-year-old plays a more versatile role in 2019, but his target share figures to increase only slightly with James White, Rex Burkhead and rookie Damien Harris in the mix. Michel is a back-end RB2 who should be upgraded in non-PPR."

The former Pitt star's first two NFL seasons weren't particularly inspiring and he was even a healthy scratch at times in 2017. It's safe to say the light went on in 2018. With all eyes on second-year John Ross, Boyd came out of nowhere to post a 75/1016/7 line and finish 17th among receivers in fantasy points despite missing two games. Boyd was only 11 behind A.J. Green in targets during the eight full games the two played together. His efficiency was also terrific (71 percent catch rate, 9.6 YPT), though touchdown sustainability is a real concern after he saw only four end zone targets and posted a 3.3 OTD. Boyd is still only 24, so it's possible we've yet to see his best work. He's a solid WR3 target."

He ranked 39th at the position in routes (451) but caught 70 percent of his targets, averaged 5.5 yards after the catch and scored 10 touchdowns. The latter is notable, as Ridley was limited to five end zone targets and posted a 4.1 OTD. The 24-year-old is an obvious strong bet for touchdown regression this season, but it's possible he sees an increase in targets in his second season. Consider him a fringe WR2 in 12-team leagues."
7.0,,,Tevin Coleman,-3.9000000000000004,RB,42,SF,10.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Coleman signed on with the 49ers following four seasons with the Falcons. The 2015 third-round pick has yet to clear 167 carries or 32 receptions in a single season but has delivered strong efficiency (4.4 YPC and 11.0 YPR in 56 career games) and touchdown production (29 scores). In fact, Coleman is one of only five players who have scored eight or more offensive touchdowns each of the past three seasons. He found pay dirt 11 times in 2016, when current 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan was the Falcons' OC. Coleman will certainly play a role in the 49ers' backfield, but he is expected to work in a timeshare with Matt Breida. Coleman is safest as a flex option."
14.0,,,Wil Lutz,4.43,K,5,NO,9.57,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Lutz finished third in fantasy points last season after posting finishes of seventh and six during his first two NFL seasons. He attempted 53 extra points last season (second most) and has never ranked lower than second in the category in his career. Lutz has steadily improved his efficiency, improving from an 82.4 field goal conversion rate in 2016 to 86.1 percent in 2017 and 93.3 percent last season. The latter was fifth best in the league. The 24-year-old is one of the game's top kickers and works in the Saints' high-scoring offense. He's a solid starter in fantasy."
12.0,,,James White,-1.1400000000000006,RB,22,NE,13.14,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"White took his game to another level in 2018 and has cemented himself as one of the game's best receiving backs. In fact, the past four seasons, White ranks first at the position in targets (328), second in receptions (243), second in receiving yards (2141) and easily first in receiving touchdowns (19). He posted career-high marks in each of those categories in 2018, as well as carries (94) and yards per carry (4.5). White was fantasy's No. 6 scoring back through Week 9 last season, but his usage dropped when Sony Michel and Rex Burkhead were active, and he ranked 27th from Week 10 on. A similar backfield share is expected in 2019, which positions White more as a fringe RB2 than a likely repeat RB1. Downgrade him in non-PPR."

The former Jaguar missed three games because of injury and was held to one weekly finish fantasy better than 19th. Robinson was held to four touchdowns, though he did enjoy a healthy 23 percent target share. The latter supplies some promise as Robinson is still only 25 and enters 2019 with a full season under his belt after missing all but three snaps in 2017 because of a torn ACL. Robinson ranked seventh at the position in targets (297) and fourth in touchdowns (20) during the 2015-16 seasons. Robinson is a fringe top 25 fantasy receiver."

The 2004 first-round pick posted three-consecutive seasons with at least 107 receptions and 1,023 yards prior to regressing in 2018, when he posted a 69/734/6 line and finished 25th in fantasy points. In addition, he managed only two top-20 fantasy weeks. Quarterback play was an obvious issue, helping Fitzgerald to a 6.6 YPT, which was ninth-worst at the position and his worst mark in the category since 2012. It's possible Kliff Kingsbury's modern offense can help Fitzgerald to a rebound season, but it's hard to see a ton of upside for a 36-year-old receiver, especially after Arizona drafted three wide receivers. Fitzgerald is best-viewed as a flex option."

He was limited to 178 routes in 11 games, which allowed for a 14/174/0 receiving line. He failed to find the end zone despite three end zone targets and caught only 42 percent of his 33 targets. It obviously wasn't a great start to Chark's career, but also nothing to overreact to. The team's quarterback situation has gone from terrible to Nick Foles, and Chark is still only 22 years old. The speedy and super-athletic Chark is a solid deep sleeper."
4.0,,,David Montgomery,-6.460000000000001,RB,40,CHI,10.46,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Bears selected Montgomery in the third round of April's draft to help replace Jordan Howard, whom they traded to the Eagles. Montgomery figures to immediately play a significant role along with change-of-pace back Tarik Cohen. He is one of the biggest backs in this class (5-foot-10, 222 pounds). His on-field profile is very similar to Kareem Hunt's, as he lacks some speed (4.63 40-yard dash) and explosiveness, but makes up for it with a combination of power, balance and especially elusiveness. The Iowa State product evaded a tackle once for every 5.1 touches last season (second best in the class) and is also a good receiver and blocker. Montgomery is a potential workhorse and, though he'll defer a lot of targets to Cohen this season, Montgomery could push for 200-plus carries. Consider him a fringe RB2."
17.0,,,Damien Williams,5.6,RB,45,KC,11.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Williams entered 2018 as an afterthought following four nondescript seasons in Miami in which he averaged an ugly 3.6 YPC on 133 carries and 6.5 yards per play on 112 targets. Williams barely played in the first half of the 2018 season, but Kareem Hunt's release led to a huge opportunity for him. He didn't disappoint, producing 352 yards and six touchdown on 60 touches in Weeks 14-17. Only two backs scored more fantasy points in the stretch. It's fair to be a bit suspicious of the now-27-year-old Williams after the small sample of success, especially after the team signed LeSean McCoy, but Williams still could lead the high-scoring Chiefs in touches out of the backfield. Williams was way overpriced during most 2019 fantasy drafts, but still could settle in as a flex."
21.0,,,Kyler Murray,4.32,QB,9,ARI,16.68,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Murray was the first overall selection in April's draft and a strong favorite to open 2019 as Arizona's starter. The Oklahoma product is extremely undersized (5-foot-10, 207 pounds), but exceptionally efficient with his arm (he set an FBS record with an 11.6 YPA last season) and highly productive with his legs (1,001 rushing yards while averaging 7.2 YPC last season). There have been only three top-10 and six top-14 fantasy seasons by rookie quarterbacks over the past decade, but all who accomplished that did a lot of damage with their legs -- an area in which Murray will shine. Rookies are always risks, but Murray's skill set and path to snaps means he should be viewed as a QB2 with QB1 upside. He's worth a late-round pick in your draft."
10.0,,,Hunter Henry,0.09999999999999964,TE,13,LAC,9.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Henry is entering his fourth NFL season but has yet to manage a top-12 fantasy campaign. The culprit, of course, has been injuries. Henry missed three games during his first two seasons while also being limited by the presence of Antonio Gates. The 2016 second-round pick was on the verge of a 2018 promotion and likely breakout, but a torn ACL cost him the entire regular season (he did return and play 13 snaps in the playoffs). Henry has posted a career 81-1,057-12 line with 20 end-zone targets in 29 games. His efficiency has been terrific (70 percent catch rate, 9.3 YPT), and he's still only 24 years old. Now healthy and finally positioned for a full-time role in a good Chargers offense, Henry has breakout written all over him. He's a fringe top-five fantasy tight end."

Moore first played more than half of Carolina's offensive snaps in Week 8 and was fantasy's No. 20 wideout from that point forward. He ended up 31st at the position in receiving yards (788) despite ranking 53rd in pass routes (406) thanks to a league-best average of 7.7 yards after catch. He was limited to two touchdowns (2.2 OTD), but offset that a bit with 172 rushing yards. The versatile 22-year-old is now Carolina's clear No. 1 wide receiver and well positioned for a second-year breakout. He's a fringe WR2."

Durability has been the obvious issue, as Fuller has missed at least two games during each of his three seasons, including six in 2017 and nine in 2018. Last season, Fuller handled career-high 21 percent target share and sat 14th at the position in fantasy points prior to suffering a season-ending injury in Week 8. The downfield playmaker has scored 11 touchdowns in 17 games during the past two seasons. Fuller is still only 25 years old and has big upside if he can stay on the field, but with DeAndre Hopkins, Keke Coutee and now Kenny Stills in the mix, he may not be worth the cost for fantasy drafters. Consider him a flex option."

The 2014 first-round pick averaged a 21 percent target share (6.9 per game) during the 10 games he played in full last season. Believe it or not, he trailed Tyreek Hill (73) by only four targets during those weeks. Eight of the 10 games came during the regular season and Watkins was fantasy's No. 16 scoring wideout those weeks. Watkins posted a healthy 9.4 YPT despite a career-low 8.4 aDOT. Bizarrely, he was limited to one end zone target, which explains his three touchdowns. Watkins' durability is an obvious concern (he has missed at least three games during three of the past four seasons) but he plays a big role in arguably the league's best offense, which makes him a WR3 with WR2 upside."

The 2014 second-round pick enjoyed a 32 percent share during Weeks 1-8 last season, but plummeted to 21 percent once Freddie Kitchens took over the offense; he was 28th at the position in fantasy points during Kitchens' eight games. Landry's catch rate plummeted to 55 percent in 2018 after clearing 67 percent in all four seasons in Miami. There's enough volume to allow Landry WR3 production, but he's now second fiddle to Beckham."
4.0,,,Saints D/ST,-2.79,DST,4,NO,6.79,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Saints' D/ST fell from 10th in fantasy points in 2017 to 14th in 2018 but had another strong campaign. New Orleans ranked top-four in forced fumbles (19) and top-seven in sacks (49) for the second season in a row but saw its interceptions fall from 20 to 12 and its D/ST touchdowns from five to one. This unit experienced minimal offseason turnover, though Sheldon Rankins' torn Achilles could be costly. A core led by Cameron Jordan, Marshon Lattimore, Demario Davis and Marcus Williams, as well as a potential second-year leap from 2018 first-round pick Marcus Davenport, will make this a starting-caliber unit most weeks."

He was on the field for 82 percent of Denver's snaps and handled 5.2 targets per game (16 percent share). Sutton was held to two top-30 fantasy weeks and underwhelmed in a full-time role down the stretch, but a 42/704/4 is solid line for a rookie, especially one who posted a 14.2 aDOT (12th highest) and dealt with 28 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (10th highest). Joe Flacco's presence figures to limit his upside, but it's possible Sutton passes out Emmanuel Sanders for No. 1 duties at some point this season. He's an intriguing breakout candidate and worth a mid-to-late-round flier."

Gallup -- a third-round pick last season -- played a situational role early on in 2018, but took over as a full-timer just prior to the acquisition of Cooper. Gallup played 77 percent of Dallas' snaps from Week 6 forward and, though he was a minimal fantasy contributor, he certainly showed flashes. Gallup's 14.1 aDOT (13th highest), 5.1 RAC (22nd), 15.4 YPR (12th) all ranked near the top of the league, though he dealt with 31 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (sixth-highest). The 23-year-old is an intriguing prospect who figures to be no lower than third in line for targets in a good offense. Take a mid-to-late-round flier."

He has lived up to it, averaging 5.0 YPC on 258 career carries, including 5.3 YPC in 2018 (seventh-best). Breida stepped up his game as a receiver in 2018, catching 84 percent of his targets (fifth-best) and averaging 8.2 yards per target (third-best) on 32 targets. Breida is on the small side at 5-foot-11, 190 pounds, which has led to a limited role near the goal line (five rushing touchdowns and seven carries inside the 5 in his career). If there's a red flag here, it's Breida's poor post-contact production (career 1.62 YAC). Breida has been effective, but he'll need to share the 49er's backfield with Tevin Coleman in 2019. That leaves the 24-year-old as more of a fringe flex option."

McLaurin is an older prospect (he turned 23 in April) with an average frame (6-foot, 208 pounds) who is extremely fast (4.35 40-yard dash). An efficient receiver, the former Buckeye averaged 14.3 yards per target last season, which topped this class. McLaurin could settle in as a depth receiver and special-teams standout, but he has a terrific opportunity for a major rookie-season role because of Washington's shaky depth chart.

Minnesota has been especially good in points allowed (ninth or better each of the past four seasons) and yards allowed (fourth or better each of the past three seasons) but added 50 sacks (third) to its arsenal in 2018. The losses of Sheldon Richardson and Andrew Sendejo cannot be ignored, but a strong core led by Linval Joseph, Danielle Hunter and Harrison Smith remains intact. Minnesota sports a solid top-five D/ST unit."
22.0,,,Delanie Walker,12.97,TE,14,TEN,9.03,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Walker is back after his 2018 season was derailed by a broken ankle after only 38 snaps. One of the league's most underrated players of the past decade, Walker entered last season having posted three consecutive top-five fantasy campaigns and five straight top-12 finishes. Prior to 2018, Walker had appeared in at least 15 games in seven consecutive seasons and, from 2014-17, finished no lower than ninth at tight end in targets, receptions and receiving yards. Walker turns 35 years old this year but is again positioned for a large target share in Tennessee. He's a terrific mid- to late-round target with top-five upside."

Sanders was terrific in 2018, catching 74 percent of his targets (seventh best) and posting a 9.0 YPT (his highest since 2014). Sanders was fantasy's No. 14 scoring wideout prior to a Week 13 torn Achilles and finished 33 percent of his outings as a top-10 fantasy receiver (10th best). Sanders is now 32 years old, but appears back to full health and is ready to roll for Week 1. Sanders has WR2 upside and is a solid mid-round target."
7.0,,,Jordan Howard,-1.17,RB,24,PHI,8.17,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Howard was traded to the Eagles after a successful three-year tenure in Chicago. With 3,370 career rushing yards, the 2016 fifth-round pick trails only Ezekiel Elliott and Todd Gurley II in the category the past three seasons. Howard has rushed for nine touchdowns each of the past two seasons but has seen both his yards per carry and yards after contact numbers fall each of the past two seasons. He has finished as a top-20 fantasy back in each of his three seasons despite a lack of receiving volume (106 career targets) and efficiency (career 68 percent catch rate and 5.4 YPT). Howard will share touches with rookie Miles Sanders and Darren Sproles this season, so his role as an early-down and short-yardage bruiser will limit him to flex numbers in non-PPR leagues."

Touchdowns were the difference-maker for the 2017 first-round pick, as he scored 10 times on 66 targets. That 15.2 percent hit rate was tops at the position and is far from sustainable. Williams racked up 12 end zone targets (13th most), but his 6.2 OTD suggests he was over his head. The good news is that Williams' efficiency was otherwise good. He caught 65 percent of his targets despite a 14.6 aDOT (10th highest) and ranked 11th in both YPR (15.4) and YPT (10.1). Williams caught a first down on a position-best 44 percent of his targets. Tyrell Williams' departure sets up Williams with a larger role in his second season. He's an obvious breakout candidate and WR3 option."

At that point, Jones had scored five touchdowns and sat 27th among wide receivers in fantasy points. Granted his usage and production was down a bit in Matt Patricia's run-first scheme last season, but Jones has now averaged a target share of at least 19 percent each of the past four seasons (three with Detroit). He has finished top 15 in aDOT each of the past three seasons and posted a solid 8.5 YPT last season despite 33 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (second highest). The 29-year-old Jones is a fringe WR3."
1.0,,,Chargers D/ST,-6.82,DST,16,LAC,7.82,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Chargers D/ST posted its worst fantasy finish in three seasons but finished 12th in 2018. The unit has ranked top-eight in points allowed each of the past two seasons but fell from sixth in both forced turnovers (27) and interceptions (18) in 2017 to 16th (20) and 15th (13), respectively, in 2018. Corey Liuget, Darius Philon and Jahleel Addae are notable offseason subtractions, but Thomas Davis and early-round picks Jerry Tillery and Nasir Adderley were huge additions at need spots. Additionally, edge rusher Joey Bosa will be healthy opposite Melvin Ingram this time around. Add that group to Casey Hayward, Derwin James (once back from IR) and Desmond King, and you have a strong unit on paper. Consider the Chargers' D/ST a top-10 unit."
3.0,,,Miles Sanders,-5.960000000000001,RB,32,PHI,8.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Eagles selected Sanders in the third round of April's draft. He joins fellow newcomer Jordan Howard atop the Philadelphia depth chart. Saquon Barkley's replacement at Penn State racked up 220 carries in 2018 and was one of the nation's most elusive backs, evading one tackler for every 6.4 touches. Sanders is shifty and agile, but not especially explosive and he's struggled with fumbles (five last season). Sanders checks in at 5-foot-11, 211 pounds and is a solid receiver and kick returner (which also fills a void for the Eagles). He had a very good combine, which was highlighted by a 4.49 40-yard dash and position-best 6.89 three cone. Sanders' shiftiness makes him a terrific complement to between-the-tackles bruiser Howard. Expect the two to split carries, with Howard the primary goal-line back and Sanders busier in passing situations. Sanders is a fringe top-25 fantasy back."
-8.0,,,Jaguars D/ST,-12.559999999999999,DST,14,JAX,4.56,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Jaguars' D/ST predictably took a step back in 2018 following about as dominant a defensive performance as you'll see in 2017. After ranking top-nine in every fantasy-relevant category the year prior, the 2018 Jaguars' D/ST fell to 22nd in forced turnovers (17) and 22nd in sacks (37). They still showed well in yardage allowed (fifth) and points allowed (fourth), however, which salvaged a top-10 fantasy campaign. Malik Jackson's offseason release is notable, but 2018 first-round pick Taven Bryan is waiting in the wings and joins a terrific core led by Calais Campbell, Myles Jack, Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and first-round pick Josh Allen. This extremely talented group should be one of the first D/STs off the board, though streamers should note that the Jaguars play the Chiefs in Week 1."

The 28-year-old wide receiver wasn't nearly as dominant last season as he was back at his peak in 2013, but was still very effective, ranking sixth among wide receivers in ypr (18.0), 10th in ypt (10.2) and fourth in RAC (6.7). Gordon was often utilized as a vertical threat (13.8 aDOT), which limited his volume a bit; during the nine full games he played, Gordon (63) was behind both Julian Edelman (83) and James White (70) in targets. Gordon ranked 24th in fantasy points during those nine weeks. He's back in the WR3 discussion, but his off-field troubles make him a risky early-round investment."

Durability has been a big culprit, as Green has missed at least three games during three of the past five seasons, including a total of 12 games over the past three seasons. He's also expected to miss around a month to begin 2019. When Green has been on the field, he has been effective, ranking no lower than 16th in fantasy points per game during each of his eight NFL seasons. Green, who is averaging 9.0 targets per game since the start of the 2017 season, turns 31 this season and figures to have a few good years left in the tank. He's a solid WR2 once back from injury."
9.0,,,Jared Goff,-7.280000000000001,QB,17,LAR,16.28,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Goff has flourished during his two seasons with Sean McVay at the helm. The Rams have finished top five in offensive touchdowns and Goff has finished top five in both yards per completion and yards per attempt each of those seasons. Goff was fantasy's No. 12 scoring QB in 2017 and improved to No. 7 in 2018. Goff adds little with his legs as he has only tallied 175 rushing yards in 38 career games. His accuracy remains a question, too, finishing no better than in the 63rd percentile in off-target rate each of his three seasons. However, terrific hands (2.1 percent drop rate) and post-catch production (6.2 RAC) from his receivers have led to excellent passing numbers. Goff is a fringe QB1."
10.0,,,LeSean McCoy,6.6899999999999995,RB,25,KC,3.31,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"McCoy appeared in 14 games in 2018, but it still felt like a lost season for the veteran back. McCoy carried the ball 161 times (his lowest total since 2009) and was targeted on 43 occasions (his lowest since 2014). McCoy struggled to a career-low 3.19 YPC (third-worst at the position) and finished dead last in YAC (0.96) for the second consecutive season. McCoy's best weekly finish was 13th, and he failed to finish as a top-20 fantasy back for the first time since 2009. McCoy has rushed for six or fewer touchdowns four of the past five seasons. He's entering his age-31 season in a much better offense, as he'll compete with Damien Williams and Darwin Thompson for lead back roles in Kansas City. The Chiefs' elite offense makes McCoy a fine mid-round target."
7.0,,,Greg Olsen,-0.5800000000000001,TE,10,CAR,7.58,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Injuries have derailed Olsen's past two seasons, limiting the veteran tight end to 44 catches for 482 yards and five touchdowns in 16 games during that span. Olsen played a majority of the snaps in seven games last season and was fantasy's No. 8 scoring tight end. Olsen's slump came after he ranked no lower than second at the position in snaps in five consecutive seasons, finishing each as a top-seven fantasy tight end. Olsen is expected back for Week 1 and should be no lower than third on the team in targets behind Christian McCaffrey and DJ Moore. Olsen is no spring chicken at 34 years old, but he's an obvious rebound candidate and can be had at a major discount late in drafts. He's worth a flier."
11.0,,,Robbie Gould,3.01,K,14,SF,7.99,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Gould has quietly been one of the most-reliable kickers in fantasy in recent seasons. The veteran has finished as a top-eight fantasy kicker three of the past four seasons, with the only exception a 2016 campaign in which he sat out the first half. Gould converted a league-best 33 of his 34 field goal attempts last season after missing only two kicks in 2017 and hitting 10 of 10 tries in 2016. All told, he has made 89 of his past 92 field goal attempts tracing back to late in the 2015 season. The red-hot Gould is now 36 years old and positioned for another run at a top-10 fantasy campaign."

The 2016 second-round pick averaged 6.3 targets per game during the 12 games Beckham played and 8.0 per game during the four he missed last season. Shepard has finished 36th, 42nd and 30th in fantasy points during his three seasons. Though the 25-year-old is primarily a short-to-intermediate area target (9.3 career aDOT) who doesn't add much in the touchdown department (six during the past two seasons), Shepard figures to reach a career-high in targets this season and that would allow him to push for WR2 production."
9.0,,,Rams D/ST,3.6399999999999997,DST,6,LAR,5.36,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Most eyes are focused on the Rams' Sean McVay-led offense, but their Wade Phillips-led defense has finished top-four in fantasy points each of the past two seasons. The Rams have ranked top-six in forced turnovers, interceptions, blocks and D/ST touchdowns both seasons. Ndamukong Suh and Lamarcus Joyner were notable offseason losses, but the team remains strong up front with Aaron Donald and added Eric Weddle in the secondary. A new-look pass rush (Dante Fowler Jr., Clay Matthews) is improved from last season, and the secondary remains a strength of the roster. This unit is, once again, a top D/ST option."
6.0,,,Royce Freeman,-2.92,RB,21,DEN,8.92,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"A third-round pick last season, Freeman looked well on his way to a terrific rookie campaign following an impressive preseason. Instead, fellow rookie Phillip Lindsay stole the spotlight, and Freeman was left running against stacked boxes (7.1 box defenders per carry was fourth-highest) in a situational role most of the season. Freeman averaged a pedestrian 4.0 YPC, but his 2.2 YAC ranked 14th at the position. Freeman struggled as a receiver, adding only 14 catches for 72 yards (3.4 YPT) on 21 targets. Lindsay's late-season struggles and Denver's new coaching staff are expeced to lead to a larger role for Freeman, but Lindsay won't completely disappear, and Freeman's receiving woes can't be ignored. There's post-hype appeal here, but Freeman should be on benches to begin 2019."
4.0,,,Kenyan Drake,-7.960000000000001,RB,38,MIA,11.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Despite playing second fiddle to Frank Gore in the rushing department, Drake posted career-high marks in touches (173), scrimmage yards (1012) and touchdowns (nine) last season. Only 13 backs scored more fantasy points. Most of Drake's damage was done as a receiver, as he ranked 13th at the position in targets (71), 14th in receiving yards (425) and ninth in aDOT (2.1). He registered only one carry inside the opponent's 5-yard line and posted a 3.9 OTD (which wasn't far off his 3.5 OTD when he scored four touchdowns in 2017). That suggests a dip in touchdowns is coming, though his role figures to expand with Gore no longer on the roster. Drake is a serviceable RB3/flex option."

Beckham averaged 10.5 targets per game during his five seasons in New York, whereas Tate averaged 8.0 per game during that same span. Of course, whereas Beckham was a down-field threat and high-end touchdown producer, Tate's 6.9 aDOT is lowest at the position and his 6.5 RAC is highest during the past five seasons. He has scored more than five touchdowns in a season just twice in nine years (2012, 2015). Tate, who has managed six-consecutive Top 30 fantasy campaigns, is suspended for four games to open 2019, but once back, the 31 year old will be a flex option."
9.0,,,Carlos Hyde,6.470000000000001,RB,27,HOU,2.53,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Hyde is now with Houston after a disappointing 2018 campaign in which he managed only 571 yards on 172 carries (3.3 YPC) and 33 yards on 10 catches (2.1 YPT) in 14 games with Cleveland and Jacksonville. Although the 27-year-old's efficiency has dipped after an explosive start to his career, Hyde has often ranked near the top of the league in stacked boxes (76th percentile or higher in average box defenders in four of his five seasons) and quietly posted a solid 1.9 YAC last season. Hyde has a path to consistent carries with only Duke Johnson Jr. in his way in Houston and, though he isn't an effective receiver, flex value is within range if he locks down 13-to-15 carries per game. He's worth a late-round flier."
15.0,,,Josh Allen,-0.11999999999999922,QB,19,BUF,15.12,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Allen's rookie season was as expected on one hand and anything but on the other. The expected part was his struggles as a passer. Allen posted an ugly 10-to-12 TD/INT mark and ranked dead last in both completion percentage (53 percent) and off-target rate (22 percent). His 6.5 yards per attempt was fourth worst despite a league-high 11.2 aDOT. The surprising aspect was Allen's elite rushing production. Allen carried the ball 89 times for 631 yards and 8 touchdowns and his 7.1 yards per carry topped the position. The latter allowed Allen the most fantasy points at the position once he returned from injury in Week 12 through Week 17. Allen's passing struggles make him a risky fantasy investment, but he's worth a late-round flier because of his rushing contributions."
2.0,,,Frank Gore,-2.8099999999999996,RB,33,BUF,4.81,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Gore joins the Bills as a complement to rookie Devin Singletary after a bizarre 2018 season in Miami, during which he averaged a healthy 4.6 YPC (2.3 YAC), but failed to rush for a single touchdown. Gore finished 46th at the position in fantasy points, which is the first time he has finished a season worse than 21st since 2006. He also missed a game for the first time since 2010. Now 36 years old, Gore won't see enough volume to allow consistent fantasy production. Even if Singletary were to miss time, Gore would share touches with TJ Yeldon. There's little fantasy appeal here."

Williams was a full-time player, but primarily worked as a situational target throughout his four seasons with the Chargers. A Week 1 Keenan Allen injury forced Williams into No. 1 receiver duties back in 2016 and he delivered with a 69/1059/7 line and an 18th-place finish in fantasy points. That was, by far, Williams' most productive season and he's otherwise failed to eclipse five scores or post a fantasy finish better than 45th. Williams' resume suggests he won't be a high-volume target (he has been limited to a 13 percent target share each of the past two seasons), but his propensity for big plays (career 16.3 YPR) provides optimism that he can push for WR2 numbers."

The former Oklahoma Sooner is extremely small (5-foot-9, 166 pounds), but he is superfast with the ability to get behind the defense and make plays with the ball in his hands. Drops (eight last season) and durability (he suffered a Lisfranc injury prior to the draft) are red flags, but Brown has the skill set of DeSean Jackson and John Brown, which allows him plenty of upside. The biggest concern here is that Brown's short-term fantasy value will be hindered by Baltimore's extremely run-heavy offense and Lamar Jackson's shaky accuracy. Brown is only worth a late flier in 2019 fantasy drafts because he has a good chance to lead the team in targets as a rookie."
5.0,,,Jared Cook,-5.15,TE,19,NO,10.15,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Cook signed with the Saints during the offseason after stints with the Titans, Rams, Packers and Raiders. After nine seasons in the league and no top-10 fantasy campaigns to show, Cook finally reached his potential with a breakout 2018 campaign. Cook hit career highs in targets (101), receptions (68), receiving yards (896) and touchdowns (six). He was fantasy's No. 5 scoring tight end. Cook's usage has been incredibly consistent, as he's averaged target shares between 16 and 18 percent each of the past seven seasons. If he keeps that streak alive in the Saints' high-scoring offense this season, Cook will no doubt post his second consecutive top-10 fantasy campaign. The 32-year-old is a solid TE1 target."
20.0,,,Drew Brees,2.3099999999999987,QB,37,NO,17.69,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Brees has remained one of the league's best passers in recent seasons, but his fantasy production has dropped off considerably since New Orleans improved defensively. Granted he sat out Week 17 last season, but Brees was limited to six top-10 fantasy weeks and finished outside the top seven for the season for the second year in a row. In 2018, Brees finished outside the top 10 in pass attempts, completions and yards for the first time since at least 2009. Brees, who has finished third or better in completion percentage nine of the past 10 seasons, has enough talent to post another top-10 season, but a more-balanced offense and fewer late-game deficits has capped his ceiling a bit."
12.0,,,Tarik Cohen,2.119999999999999,RB,38,CHI,9.88,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Cohen played an expanded role as a change-of-pace and receiving back last season and did enough damage to produce the 11th-most fantasy points at the position. Cohen ranked top-six among backs in targets (91), receptions (71), receiving yards (725), touchdown catches (five), yards per target (8.0) and average depth of target (3.6). That helped overcome underwhelming rushing production. The undersized Cohen has ranked 71st and 70th among 72 qualified backs in YAC and has three total carries inside the 5 in his two NFL seasons. Cohen's role allowed him four top-six fantasy weeks, but also six finishes worse than 33rd. Jordan Howard was replaced by David Montgomery, so 5-foot-6, 190-pound Cohen's situational role is unlikely to change. His limited rushing and goal-line role makes him safest as a fringe top-25 back."

Kirk was on the field for 85 percent of the team's pass plays and handled a generous 21 percent target share before landing on injured reserve with a broken foot. Kirk failed to post a single top-10 fantasy week, but was efficient, managing an 8.8 YPT and 5.3 RAC. Larry Fitzgerald is another year older, so the 22-year-old Kirk could very well take over as the team's No. 1 receiver this season, though he'll need to fend off rookies Andy Isabella and and KeeSean Johnson. Arizona's quarterback upgrade to Kyler Murray further helps Kirk's breakout chances. Consider him a borderline flex."

Westbrook has been a target hog. He handled a 22 percent target share as a rookie and a 21 percent share in 2018. Overall, he's averaging 6.4 targets per game. Westbrook averaged 5.6 yards after the catch last season, which was 13th best among wideouts. Jacksonville's abysmal quarterback situation limited him to one top 10 fantasy week, but the addition of Nick Foles figures to help his efficiency. Jacksonville didn't make an impact addition at wideout during the offseason, solidifying the 25-year-old Westbrook as a solid flex target."

Samuel did make some noise in the touchdown department last season, scoring seven times on 47 touches, though his 4.4 OTD suggests he was over his head. Samuel played at least 60 percent of Carolina's snaps in five games last season and was fantasy's No. 32 WR those weeks. There's third-year breakout potential here, so Samuel is fine mid-to-late-round option."
14.0,,,Devin Singletary,5.33,RB,57,BUF,8.67,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Bills selected Singletary in the third round of April's draft. Singletary is very undersized (5-foot-7, 203 pounds) and lacks home run speed (4.66 40-yard dash), but makes up for that with toughness and elusiveness. The Florida Atlantic star ran for 22 touchdowns and ranked among the top backs in the class in broken tackle rate and evaded tackle rate in 2018. Singletary can contribute as a receiver and is a strong pass-blocker. Following the offseason release of LeSean McCoy, the rookie is positioned for a big role ahead of Frank Gore and TJ Yeldon. Take a shot on Singletary in the middle rounds."
23.0,,,Philip Rivers,6.620000000000001,QB,13,LAC,16.38,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Rivers enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2018, throwing 32 touchdowns, which matched his second-highest total of the past decade. Rivers also cleared 4,200 passing yards for the sixth consecutive season and finished top five in yards per completion for the third consecutive season. Despite yet another terrific passing season, Rivers was limited to six top-10 fantasy weeks and failed to finish as a top-10 fantasy QB for the fourth time in five seasons. The culprit? Minimal rushing contributions. Rivers hasn't scored a rushing touchdown since 2011 and has a total of 5 rushing yards on 36 carries over the past two seasons. Unless your league awards more points for passing categories, Rivers is limited to QB2 territory."

12.0,,,Latavius Murray,4.04,RB,29,NO,7.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Murray signed on with the Saints to replace Mark Ingram as a complement to lead back Alvin Kamara. Murray has been the poster boy for mediocrity, having finished each of the past four seasons with a yards per carry mark no higher than 4.13 and no lower than 3.90. Murray has been between 103 and 264 receiving yards each of the past three seasons. The area where Murray has stood out is the touchdown department. Since 2015, he ranks second in the NFL in rushing touchdowns (32), fourth in rushing OTD (27.7) and fifth in carries inside the 5-yard line (40). Murray is a sneaky flex in touchdown-only leagues, but his real appeal is as arguably the most valuable handcuff in fantasy. If Kamara goes down, Murray will be in the RB1 mix."

Brown's best season saw him post a 65/1,003/7 line in 2015. He was fantasy's No. 25-scoring receiver that season, but he has been unable to come close to that production since. A sickle trait issue cost Brown game action during his stint in Arizona, but with that behind him, the 29-year-old didn't miss a single game en route to a 42/717/5 line last season. Brown's 14.9 average depth of target is highest in the NFL among 41 players with 400-plus targets since he entered the league. Brown figures to be an extremely boom/bust producer as a situational deep threat for strong-armed but inaccurate Josh Allen. He's only worth a late flier, especially in non-PPR."

The speedster is now 32 years old and has appeared in 16 games only twice in his 11-year career. Last season, Jackson was limited to 47 touches, but scored five touchdowns and posted an 18.9 YPR (highest) and 10.8 YPT (sixth highest). His 17.4 YPR and 10.0 YPT are tops in the NFL since he entered the league in 2008. Jackson is likely to miss a game or two and will serve as a situational deep threat behind Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery, but this is an offense that ranks fifth in passing attempts and third in passing touchdowns over the past two seasons. He'll see enough work to keep him in the flex discussion in non-PPR."

Metcalf is huge (6-foot-3, 228 pounds) with terrific explosiveness, speed and downfield play-making ability. The former Ole Miss star is young (he turns 22 in December) and raw, the latter of which can somewhat be attributed to injury woes. Metcalf showed off his speed and size at the combine with a 4.33 40-yard dash and 27 bench reps, though he did raise major red flags by struggling in quickness events. Metcalf has the upside to become one of the league's next premiere vertical receivers, especially with Russell Wilson on the other end of the battery, but he figures to be more boom/bust than a consistent producer as a situational deep threat in Seattle's super-run-heavy offense in 2019."

Crowder aligned inside on 77 percent of his routes during four seasons with Washington and will operate between Robby Anderson and Quincy Enunwa in New York. Crowder cleared 65 receptions and 780 receiving yards in both 2016 and 2017, posting his best fantasy campaign (26th) during the former, but missed seven games due to injury in 2018. Extremely undersized, the 5-foot-8, 185-pound Crowder has 14 touchdowns (13.3 OTD) in 56 career games, seven of which came during the aforementioned 2016 season. New Jets head coach Adam Gase has made good use of his receivers, which adds to Crowder's fantasy appeal. He's a fine target in the middle rounds, but downgrade him in non-PPR leagues."
12.0,,,Jimmy Graham,4.46,TE,12,GB,7.54,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Despite high expectations, Graham's first season with Aaron Rodgers was a disappointment. Graham appeared in all 16 of Green Bay's games but finished 12th in fantasy points. He averaged 8.2 fantasy points per game, which was his worst mark in the category since his rookie season (2010). Only three tight ends ran more routes, but Graham barely cracked the top 10 in targets (84), receptions (55) and receiving yards (636). The biggest culprit was touchdowns. Once a dominant force in the area, Graham was held to just two scores. On the plus side, his seven end-zone targets (eighth most) and 4.8 OTD suggest regression to the mean is on tap in 2019. The 32-year-old is best-viewed as a TE2, but has TE1 upside."
1.0,,,Gerald Everett,-4.42,TE,9,LAR,5.42,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Everett took another step forward during his second NFL season, but the 2017 second-round pick has yet to emerge as a viable fantasy play. Stuck in a timeshare with Tyler Higbee in an offense heavy on three-wide-receiver sets, Everett was limited to 34 percent of the snaps and 3.1 targets per game last season. He was limited to two top-10 fantasy weeks, and 24 percent of his 49 targets were not catchable (second-highest). The Rams' high-scoring offense supplies Everett with some appeal in his third NFL season, but his situational role in Sean McVay's tight-end-unfriendly scheme limits him to a late flier in deep leagues."

Things didn't go well early, as Anderson was limited to 5.25 targets per game and was fantasy's No. 59 wide receiver during Weeks 1-9. Life improved once Sam Darnold returned from injury, however, as Anderson's targets jumped to 10.0 per game and he was fantasy's No. 7 WR during Weeks 14-17. Anderson has ranked 19th in YPR each of the past two seasons and has posted a top 3 aDOT in two of his three NFL seasons. The vertical threat is in his prime years at 26 and has upside as second-year Darnold's top target. He's a fringe WR3."
22.0,,,Titans D/ST,16.67,DST,6,TEN,5.33,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Tennessee entered 2018 with one of the league's best defenses on paper, and it showed. The Titans allowed 303 points (third-fewest) and 5,334 yards (eighth-fewest) en route to posting their first top-10 D/ST fantasy campaign since 2008. Despite the improvements, Tennessee ranked 23rd in interceptions (11) and hasn't finished better than 15th in forced turnovers since the aforementioned 2008 season. The edge rush took a beating during the offseason with Derrick Morgan, Brian Orakpo and Will Compton departing but remains in solid shape with addition Cameron Wake and second-year Harold Landry. They join the likes of Jurrell Casey, Jayon Brown, Wesley Woodyard, Kevin Byard, Adoree' Jackson and first-round pick Jeffery Simmons to form a very good defense. Consider this a fringe starting D/ST."
4.0,,,Ka'imi Fairbairn,-4.699999999999999,K,16,HOU,8.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"John Christian Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a Fairbairn paced all kickers in fantasy points last season thanks to a league-high 42 field goal attempts. He converted on 37 (or 88.1 percent), which was a step forward after he hit 20 of 25 attempts in 2017. Fairbairn also ranked eighth in extra-point attempts (he made 39 of 41). Houston's kicker benefited greatly from a strong offense that struggled to convert drives into touchdowns. It's possible that dynamic changes in 2019, but an offensive line still full of holes makes a big leap unlikely. That should make the 25-year-old a viable weekly fantasy starter."
9.0,,,Baker Mayfield,-6.41,QB,27,CLE,15.41,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Mayfield enjoyed one of the best rookie quarterback campaigns of all time last season and Cleveland's offseason addition of Odell Beckham Jr. only adds to his 2019 fantasy appeal. Head coach Freddie Kitchens took over as Cleveland's playcaller in Week 9 last season and Mayfield scored the 10th-most fantasy points among QBs from that point forward. During those eight games, Cleveland averaged 3.1 touchdowns per game (fifth most), 76 percent of which were passes (fifth highest). Mayfield adds little with his legs and needs to cut down on interceptions, which could limit his fantasy upside a bit, but entering his second season with Beckham, Jarvis Landry, David Njoku and Nick Chubb at his disposal, Mayfield can safely be considered a fringe QB1 with big upside. Side note: The Buccaneers led the NFL in both passing yards and interceptions during new Browns offensive coordinator Todd Monken's three seasons with the team."
12.0,,,Duke Johnson,0.75,RB,36,HOU,11.25,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Johnson has emerged as one of the league's best receiving backs since he was drafted in the third round of the 2015 draft. He ranks third at the position in targets (297), third in receptions (235), first in receiving yards (2170) and 11th in touchdown catches (eight) the past four seasons. Despite the success, Johnson had career lows in carries (40) and targets (62) last season. Fantasy's No. 11 scoring back in 2017 plummeted to a career-worst 37th in 2018. A bounceback figures to be in the cards in 2019 as Johnson was traded to Houston where he'll play a major role following Lamar Miller's torn ACL. Johnson figures to be limited a bit as a rusher, but will certainly be very busy as Houston's primary receiving back. He's in the RB2 mix."
10.0,,,Jason Witten,3.49,TE,11,DAL,6.51,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Witten has come out of retirement and is back at the top of the depth chart in Dallas. When we last saw Witten, he was an every-down player and handled a solid 5.4 targets per game back in 2017. Primarily utilized as a sure-handed, short-area target who offers little after the catch, Witten finished 33rd at the position in fantasy points per snap. Of course, Witten led all tight ends with 897 snaps and, because volume is king, he managed a ninth-place finish in fantasy points. Witten is now 37 years old and expected to play more of a situational role in 2019. He hasn't posted a fantasy season better than ninth since 2013 and that's unlikely to change this season. He's a back-end TE2."
25.0,,,T.J. Hockenson,17.96,TE,15,DET,7.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Detroit selected Hockenson eighth overall in April's draft. The Iowa product joins free-agent signing Jesse James atop the Lions' depth chart. Hockenson is a terrific pass catcher and good blocker who has drawn comparisons to Travis Kelce, Rob Gronkowski and even former Hawkeye George Kittle. Hockenson is a superb athlete, with good size (6-foot-5, 251 pounds) and toughness. He crushed it at the combine, placing near the top of the position in all but the bench press. Hockenson has every-down tight end written all over him, but, as is usual for rookie tight ends, he figures to learn the ropes in 2019 before emerging as a fantasy threat in 2020. Hockenson doesn't need to be on your radar in 10-team leagues in 2019."
5.0,,,O.J. Howard,-4.49,TE,34,TB,9.49,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Howard finished 2018 as the No. 14 scoring tight end, which is impressive when you consider he missed six games due to injury. Howard, who ranked sixth prior to the injury, accomplished the feat with low volume (4.7 targets per game) and elite efficiency (Howard has led the position in both YPT and YPR in both of his two NFL seasons). Howard has also scored touchdowns at an unsustainable rate (11 career TDs, 5.9 career OTD). The 24-year-old is clearly a rising star, but durability (eight missed games) and the presence of new coach Bruce Arians (his tight ends ranked 31st in fantasy points during five seasons in Arizona) are red flags. But Howard has played too well to be discounted. He has elite upside but will cost you a sixth round pick."
6.0,,,Peyton Barber,-2.76,RB,41,TB,8.76,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"An undrafted free-agent signing back in 2016, Barber plodded his way to a pair of nondescript first two NFL seasons. He was forced into a much larger role in 2018, however, with second-round pick Ronald Jones struggling badly immediately upon joining the team. Barber went on to rack up 234 carries (ninth-most), but failed to impress, averaging a career-low 3.7 YPC (1.9 YAC). Despite ranking 10th at the position in snaps (583), Barber was targeted only 28 times. He turned those looks into 20 catches for 92 yards (3.3 YPT). Barber finished five weeks better than 37th at the position in fantasy points. The Buccaneers will be hoping for a much better season from Jones, but even if Barber remains the starter, he's a replacement-level back who is only worth a mid-to-late pick."
0.0,,,Adrian Peterson,0.0,RB,48,WSH,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Peterson's 2018 prospects seemed dim during most of last offseason, but Derrius Guice's torn ACL allowed the former fantasy star one more shot at lead back duties. Peterson held down the fort, finishing fifth in the league with 251 carries and averaging 4.2 yards per carry. As usual, Peterson played a minimal role as a receiver (26 targets) but scored enough touchdowns (eight) to manage a 19th-place finish in fantasy points. Peterson re-signed with Washington, but with Guice healthy and ready to roll, the 2018 second-round pick will be the team's primary back. The 34-year-old Peterson will have flex value only if Guice misses time."
0.0,,,Kareem Hunt,0.0,RB,0,CLE,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Following a top-five fantasy campaign as a rookie, Hunt was well on his way to a repeat performance in 2018, having scored 14 touchdowns in 11 games. However, when video surfaced of an off-field assault, Hunt was released by Kansas City and sat out the rest of the season. Hunt signed with Cleveland, though he will be suspended for the first eight games of 2019. Hunt is entering his age-24 season and has been one of the league's most effective backs over the past two seasons. He's averaging 4.8 YPC (2.5 YAC) on 453 attempts and an outstanding 8.4 YPT on 99 targets. Hunt will be an intriguing handcuff down the stretch, and he's talented enough to push Nick Chubb for touches, but it's hard to imagine a significant impact as long as Chubb is healthy. Hunt is worth stashing on season-long rosters only in leagues with deep benches."
4.0,,,Mason Crosby,-3.1399999999999997,K,10,GB,7.14,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Crosby was fantasy's No. 7 kicker in 2018 after finishing 16th or worse each of the previous three seasons. He attempted 37 field goals, which tied for his second most in a single season in his 12-year career. Crosby has benefited from plenty of opportunity in Green Bay's high-scoring offense, but efficiency has eluded him nearly his entire career. He made 30 of 37 attempts last season (81.1 percent) and, in terms of expected conversion rate based on distance, Crosby has been below average in nine of 12 seasons, including each of the past three. Crosby is a fringe fantasy starter and loses some value in leagues that dock for misses."
3.0,,,Jamaal Williams,-2.74,RB,31,GB,5.74,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Williams has struggled with efficiency during his first two NFL seasons, but he has still managed to register 921 snaps and 326 touches during that span. The 2017 fourth-round pick increased his rookie-season 3.6 YPC to 3.8 in 2018, but his YAC fell from 1.9 to 1.7. That is despite facing extremely light boxes both seasons. Williams has also ranked near the bottom of the position in catch rate (73 percent) on 71 career targets. Though he'll sustain a role in the Packers' backfield, Williams won't see enough volume to allow fantasy relevance as long as the more effective Aaron Jones is healthy."

Valdes-Scantling posted a 38/581/2 line and a solid 8.2 YPT despite 31 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (fifth highest). He averaged 5.7 yards after the catch, which was 11th best at the position. Especially with Randall Cobb gone, the Packers' wide receiver depth chart is wide open. Valdes-Scantling, who stands 6-foot-5 and aligned in the slot on 46 percent of his routes as a rookie, will have a shot at flex value if he locks down No. 2 or perhaps No. 3 duties in Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers-led offense. He's worth a mid-round flier."
13.0,,,Packers D/ST,8.59,DST,18,GB,4.41,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Green Bay's D/ST ranked 23rd in fantasy points last season, which marked the unit's third consecutive finish outside the top 20. The Packers struggled badly in most departments, ranking 29th in interceptions (seven) and forced turnovers (15), 26th in tackles for loss (80), 15th in yardage allowed (5,670) and 11th in points allowed (400). On the plus side, the unit ranked eighth with 44 sacks, which marks the Packers' seventh top-10 finish in the category the past nine seasons. Muhammad Wilkerson and Nick Perry (both barely played last season), as well as Clay Matthews, are gone, but Adrian Amos, Preston Smith, Za'Darius Smith, Rashan Gary and Darnell Savage were key offseason additions. They join Kenny Clark, Mike Daniels, Blake Martinez and Jaire Alexander to form an intriguing sleeper D/ST."

Winston completed 65 percent of his passes and was off target on 16 percent of his attempts, both of which were career-best marks. Winston also rushed for a career-high 281 yards despite appearing in just 11 games. During the nine weeks he started, Winston ranked fourth in fantasy points. He continues to struggle with interceptions (58 in 56 career games), though part of that is a product of a propensity for attacking deep down field (he's ranked top five in aDOT in all four seasons). Winston has flashed enough to keep him in the QB1 discussion."

6.0,,,Vance McDonald,-3.24,TE,21,PIT,9.24,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"A consistent 2018 campaign led McDonald to a career-best 10th-place finish in fantasy points. The veteran tight end handled at least four targets in 12 of 15 games and scored between six and 14 fantasy points in 13 games. He ended up with a 50-640-4 line, and his eight end-zone targets were fifth most at the position. McDonald's 7.8 RAC was fourth-best last season, and he's never finished a season in which he's handled 40-plus targets lower than ninth in the category. A position-high 17 percent of his targets were on screens last season. With Antonio Brown and Jesse James gone, McDonald could move as high as second in targets on a good Steelers offense. The 29-year-old is a fine TE1."
1.0,,,Rashaad Penny,-7.35,RB,66,SEA,8.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Penny was a surprise selection in the first round of the 2018 draft, and his rookie season was derailed by injuries and the emergence of Chris Carson. Penny appeared in 14 games and was on the field for 17 percent of Seattle's offensive snaps. The good news is that he was effective, racking up 419 yards on 85 carries (4.9 YPC) and 75 yards on 12 targets (6.3 YPT). The 23-year-old back has the size, talent and skill set to emerge into a three-down back, but he remains behind Carson on the depth chart. Penny is a terrific handcuff but lacks stand-alone value in his current role."
15.0,,,Jacoby Brissett,0.40000000000000036,QB,15,IND,14.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Brissett is back as the Colts starter following Andrew Luck's shocking retirement. Brissett started the entire 2017 season for Indianapolis, but struggled to only four Top 10 fantasy weeks and a 20th-place finish for the season. Brissett was conservative (7.5 aDOT), but only completed 59 percent of his passes. He avoided interceptions (seven), but only threw 13 touchdowns. On the plus side, Brissett's 63 carries and four rushing touchdowns were sixth-most at the position. Brissett is now in his third season with the team and should be better with an improved supporting cast, including a strong offensive line. He's best viewed as a fringe Top 20 option."

Sanu worked ahead of Ridley most weeks and quietly tied him in targets (92). Sanu posted a 66/838/4 line and finished 31st in fantasy points (he was 29th in 2017). Sanu is still in his prime at age-29 and is a super reliable short-area target for Matt Ryan. Sanu has ranked Top 15 in catch rate and Bottom 15 in aDOT during each of the past four seasons. He posted a career-high 9.1 YPT in 2018. Touchdowns are the red flag here, as Sanu has never cleared five in a season. The veteran slot man figures to defer plenty of targets to second-year Ridley, but there are plenty to go around in this offense. Sanu remains a sneaky flex in deeper leagues."

Volume was one of the culprits, as Stafford failed to finish top 10 in dropbacks, pass attempts and passing yardage for the first time since 2010. Efficiency was also an issue, as Stafford was off target on 19 percent of his throws (sixth worst) and posted 6.81 yards per attempt (worst since his rookie season in 2009). Stafford is still in his prime at 31 years old, but has evolved into a conservative passer (6.8 aDOT was third lowest last season). He offers little with his legs with 54 attempts, 169 yards and zero touchdowns over the past two seasons. He's a back-end QB2 with limited upside in Detroit's run-first offense."
14.0,,,Chris Thompson,5.359999999999999,RB,35,WSH,8.64,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Thompson has emerged as one of the league's better receiving backs in recent years, but injuries have derailed his chances for a full-on breakout. The 28-year-old back has missed exactly six games each of the past two seasons. Thompson's best season came in 2017, when he put up 804 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns on 103 touches in 10 games. Thompson has never cleared 68 carries in a season (though he has benefited from light boxes), but he's averaging an impressive 4.96 YPC in his career. Interestingly, he paced the position in YPR (13.1) and YPT (9.8) in 2017 but finished sixth-worst (6.4) and fifth-worst (4.9), respectively, last season. Thompson will continue to be limited to passing situations behind Adrian Peterson and Derrius Guice, which severely limits his fantasy upside. He's worth a look in deep PPR leagues."
9.0,,,Ronald Jones II,4.56,RB,37,TB,4.44,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Jones was one of the youngest players selected in the 2018 draft, and maybe that's the excuse for what was an ugly rookie season. The second-round pick struggled right out of the gate and ended up managing only 88 snaps in nine games. He registered 44 yards on 23 carries (1.9 YPC, 1.3 YAC) and 33 yards on nine targets (3.7 YPT). Jones is undersized at 5-foot-11, 205 pounds, which might limit his early-down and goal-line opportunities, but the depth chart is wide open in Tampa Bay. He's a post-hype sleeper with tons of raw talent and upside as a receiver. Throw a dart in the late rounds."
0.0,,,Eagles D/ST,-7.11,DST,13,PHI,7.11,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Eagles' D/ST finished as a top-six fantasy unit in Doug Pederson's first two seasons with the team but plummeted to 26th last season. The Eagles struggled in nearly every area, falling from fourth in forced turnovers, yardage allowed and points allowed in 2017 to 22nd, 23rd and 12th, respectively, last season. They didn't score a D/ST touchdown after managing at least five in each of the previous four seasons. The Eagles lost Jordan Hicks, Michael Bennett and Haloti Ngata but added Malik Jackson, Vinny Curry, Andrew Sendejo and Zach Brown in the offseason. The newcomers join a group led by Fletcher Cox, Malcolm Jenkins and Brandon Graham. This is a good defense and prime rebound candidate. A Week 1 home matchup with Washington adds to the unit's draft appeal."
5.0,,,Cam Newton,-13.09,QB,38,CAR,18.09,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Newton was well on his way to one of his best seasons in 2018, but a shoulder injury derailed him down the stretch. Newton sat third at the position in fantasy points through Week 13, but was limited to a pair of weeks outside the top 20 prior to being shut down for Weeks 16 and 17. We saw a new-look Newton, as his 7.3 aDOT was easily a career low and led to career-best marks in completion rate (68 percent) and off-target rate (14 percent). The result? Carolina scored two-plus offensive touchdowns in every game through Week 14. Even missing two games, Newton finished top five at the position in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns for the eighth consecutive season. If he's healthy for Week 1, Newton remains a solid QB1 play with upside."
8.0,,,Seahawks D/ST,3.4000000000000004,DST,21,SEA,4.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Seattle D/ST finished 14th in fantasy points last season, which marks its first finish worse than ninth since 2010. Seattle ranked 18th in interceptions (12), 24th in tackles for loss (82) and 25th in yards per play (5.92). The unit was 10th in forced turnovers (26) and 11th in points allowed (347), though a league-high 14 fumble recoveries will be hard to repeat. Earl Thomas, Frank Clark and Justin Coleman were big offseason losses, though Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah will help offset those moves. This is a defense with good coaching but very shaky personnel in some areas, especially cornerback. Add and start the Seattle D/ST only when the unit is at home and the matchup is good. That will be the case in Week 1 against the Bengals."
14.0,,,Ravens D/ST,8.67,DST,18,BAL,5.33,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Baltimore's D/ST has been a fantasy powerhouse for a long time, posting four top-seven campaigns the past five seasons and seven in the past 11 seasons. In 2018, the Ravens allowed a league-low 4,687 yards, and their 287 points allowed ranked second-best. On the other hand, the unit ranked 22nd in forced turnovers and was outside the top 10 in sacks for the fourth consecutive season. The worst news is that Baltimore lost its Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7 snap-getters from 2018 (Eric Weddle, C.J. Mosley, Terrell Suggs, Za'Darius Smith). Earl Thomas was a strong addition, but this unit has more holes than we're used to. Expect a step back to more of a streaming option."

Volume was far from an issue, as Davis racked up 112 targets (18th most), but he still managed only a 28th-place finish in fantasy points and five top-40 fantasy weeks. After a league-high 33 percent of balls thrown his way were off target in 2017, 27 percent missed the mark in 2018 (12th highest). Davis was, in turn, held to a 58 percent catch rate. A third-year breakout could be in the cards, but with Adam Humphries, A.J. Brown and a healthy Delanie Walker now in the fold, the 24-year-old Davis is best valued as a flex target in Tennessee's run-heavy offense."

-2.0,,,Daniel Jones,-2.02,QB,26,NYG,0.02,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Giants selected Jones with the sixth overall pick in April's draft. The 6-foot-5, 221-pound Duke product was far from impressive in his final FBS season. Jones was off target on 9.4 percent of his throws (best in this class), but he was very conservative (8.1 aDOT), which led to a weak 6.8 YPA. Jones did deal with a ton of drops, but his weak efficiency and struggles throwing the deep ball are red flags. Jones is a good athlete who will add some value at the pro level with his legs. Eli Manning will be the team's starter as long as he's healthy and the Giants are competitive this season, but Jones figures to get a few starts late in the season. He's only a fantasy option in dynasty."

1.0,,,Cowboys D/ST,-3.84,DST,11,DAL,4.84,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Dallas' D/ST finished as a mid-pack fantasy unit again last season and hasn't posted a campaign better than 14th since 2009. The perpetually mediocre unit finished 10th in forced fumbles (14), seventh in yards allowed (5,268) and sixth in points allowed (324) but was 26th in interceptions (nine) and 16th in sacks (39) while scoring only one touchdown. Adding Robert Quinn helps offset the loss of David Irving and likely Randy Gregory on the defensive line. This unit is not without holes but has plenty of star power in the forms of DeMarcus Lawrence, Jaylon Smith, Leighton Vander Esch, Sean Lee and Byron Jones, who supply some upside. The Dallas D/ST is a streaming option when the matchup is right, and that will be the case Weeks 1-3 (Giants, Redskins, Dolphins)."
1.0,,,Eric Ebron,-6.22,TE,17,IND,7.22,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"After four underwhelming seasons in Detroit in which he totaled 12 touchdowns and failed to post a single top-12 fantasy campaign, Ebron exploded for 14 scores (fifth most in the entire NFL) and a fifth-place fantasy finish in his first season with the Colts. Ebron finished in the top six at the position in targets (111), receptions (66) and receiving yards (five). He paced the position with a whopping 18 end-zone targets. Ebron's path to the huge season was bizarre as, during the six games both he and Jack Doyle were active, Doyle ran 151 routes and was targeted 33 times, compared to 101 routes and 22 targets for Ebron. Doyle returns healthy for 2019, which makes Ebron's regression a strong bet and Andrew Luck's retirement only adds to the probability of a dropoff. The 26-year-old is best valued as a TE2."
13.0,,,Kirk Cousins,-2.5999999999999996,QB,11,MIN,15.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Cousins posted career-high marks in completion percentage (70.1 percent) and passing touchdowns (30) in his first season with the Vikings, but still managed his worst fantasy season (12th) since he became a full-time starter in 2015. Cousins was extremely conservative, posting a career-low 7.2 aDOT, which was sixth lowest in the NFL and led to an ugly 10.1 yards per completion (fourth lowest). Cousins rushed for at least three touchdowns during each of his three seasons as the Redskins' starter, but managed only one touchdown last season. He posted a healthy seven top-10 fantasy weeks, but finished 20th or worse six times. Minnesota is expected to operate a run-first offense this season, so Cousins is best viewed as a midrange QB2."

10.0,,,Jimmy Garoppolo,-6.359999999999999,QB,23,SF,16.36,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"To this point, the Garoppolo experiment has not worked out for San Francisco. The former Patriot was acquired during the 2017 season, but has appeared in only nine games due to injury. In fact, the 27-year-old has yet to appear in more than six games in a regular season. Garoppolo's play has also left something to be desired. In nine games with the 49ers, he's contributed 13 touchdowns, thrown 8 interceptions and fumbled 5 times. His production is almost exactly identical to that posted by 2017 undrafted free agent Nick Mullens in eight games last season. Garoppolo remains a bit of an unknown, but his combination of talent and the presence of head coach Kyle Shanahan offers him fantasy upside. He's a back-end QB2 and post-hype sleeper."
-5.0,,,Steelers D/ST,-9.870000000000001,DST,9,PIT,4.87,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Believe it or not, the Steelers have led the NFL in sacks the past two seasons. They generated 52 last season to go with 99 tackles for loss (eighth-most) while allowing 5.3 yards per play (sixth-best) and blocking three kicks (second-most). Pittsburgh's D/ST salvaged an eighth-place fantasy season despite ranking 29th in forced turnovers (15), its lowest total since 2011 (15). Following minimal offseason turnover, Pittsburgh remains outstanding up front with T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, Stephon Tuitt and Javon Hargrave leading the way. The unit is suspect beyond that, though LB Devin Bush was scooped up in the first round of the draft, and Steven Nelson is an underrated addition at corner. This is a mid-pack D/ST option in 2019, though a Week 1 trip to New England hurts the draft appeal."

Hardman is undersized at 5-foot-10, 187 pounds, but the Georgia product is extremely explosive and versatile. Hardman has terrific speed (4.33 40-yard dash) and toughness (17 bench reps) and dominates with the ball in his hands (8.7 RAC in 2018). He has struggled with drops (eight on 91 career targets) and fumbles (eight on 39 touches last season). Hardman figures to be utilized as a short-area RAC target, lid lifter and a returner. He's positioned for situational rookie season role in a high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense, which makes him a fine bench stash in deeper leagues."

Dorsett was a full-time player during Julian Edelman's four-game suspension last season, but was limited to a 16/165/2 line and the 45th-most fantasy points among wideouts during the span. He was a non-factor for a majority of the rest of the season and failed to finish as a Top 75 fantasy receiver for the fourth time in four NFL seasons. The 2015 first-round pick spent his early career as a downfield target, but was used more in the short area in 2018 (10.3 aDOT). He's undersized at 5-foot-10, 185 pounds and offers little near the goal line (six career touchdowns). Dorsett has little value behind Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon and likely Demaryius Thomas."

The scat back was limited to 85 carries and four offensive touchdowns but ranked top-10 among backs in pass routes (294), targets (81), receptions (63) and average depth of target (2.3). He finished 27th in fantasy points but managed only one weekly finish better than 18th. Hines' role allowed some fantasy relevance, but he struggled with efficiency, with his 3.7 YPC, 1.5 YAC and 5.2 YPT all ranking near the bottom of the position. Hines is positioned for a similar role in a Colts' offense that will need to throw more than expected with Andrew Luck gone. Hines is a PPR flex in deeper leagues."

Edmonds was held to 208 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 60 carries (3.5 YPC, 1.5 YAC) and 103 yards on 23 targets (4.5 YPT). The 23-year-old didn't stand out as a rookie but remains positioned as Johnson's primary handcuff, which supplies him with value in deeper leagues."

Houston ranked fourth in forced turnovers (29), 11th in sacks (43) and second in fantasy points (133) and scored four touchdowns. Houston allowed 316 points (fourth-fewest) after surrendering a league-high 436 points in 2017. Four of coach Bill O'Brien's past five and six of DC Romeo Crennel's past seven defenses have been better than average in touchdowns allowed. This unit is still solid at linebacker and at edge rusher, but the offseason losses of Jadeveon Clowney and in the secondary can't be overlooked. To make matters worse, a Week 1 trip to New Orleans means this D/ST is not a great draft selection."
6.0,,,Derrius Guice,-5.0,RB,93,WSH,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Guice was the 59th overall pick in the 2018 draft, but a torn ACL in the preseason ended his rookie campaign before it even started. Guice is expected to be healthy for Week 1, but especially with Chris Thompson back, Adrian Peterson re-signed and Bryce Love drafted, it's hard to imagine the LSU product playing a full-time role early in the season. On the plus side, Guice is only 22 years old and has the size and ability to operate as a three-down back. He'll be a risky play early this season but has breakout potential once he's back to 100 percent."

Healthy and operating as Green Bay's No. 3 wide receiver during Weeks 1-4, Allison posted a 19/289/2 line and was fantasy's No. 28 scorer at the position. Allison has registered only 55 catches in 30 career games, but his strong 2018 efficiency (67 percent catch rate, 10.1 YPT) and the Packers' shaky depth chart positions him well for a run at No. 2 duties opposite Davante Adams. In that scenario, Allison would, at least, be on the flex radar. He's an intriguing mid-round flier."
13.0,,,Rex Burkhead,11.35,RB,45,NE,1.65,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Burkhead has appeared in 23 games across two seasons with the Patriots, handling roughly one quarter of the carries and just under 10 percent of the targets during both seasons. Last season's 3.3 YPC was both the worst of his career and fourth-worst at the position, but note that he has finished second and first, respectively, in average box defenders each of the past two seasons. The 29-year-old is a competent rusher and effective receiver with a defined role in one of the league's best offenses. He has little standalone value, and that's doubtful to change with James White, Sony Michel and Damien Harris all on the roster."

His best season included a 75/833/5 receiving line back in 2016, which allowed a 33rd-place finish in fantasy points. Beasley's production plummeted in 2017 prior to rebounding for a 65/672/3 line last season. Beasley has aligned in the slot on 88 percent of his career routes and has never cleared five touchdowns or five end zone targets in a single season. The undersized 30-year-old will soak up short area targets, but this is a run-heavy offense led by an inaccurate quarterback who likes to throw down field. Beasley lacks upside and is only worth a late look in PPR leagues."

Albeit a small sample, Pettis averaged 17.3 YPR and 10.6 YPT while hauling in 27 of 44 targets for 467 yards and five touchdowns. He ran at least 80 percent of the pass routes in four games stretching from Week 12-15 and was fantasy's No. 8 wideout during the span. Especially with Jimmy Garoppolo back under center, the 23-year-old Pettis is positioned for a step forward in his second season. He's a flex option with upside."

The unit jumped to fifth in interceptions (17), eighth in sacks (44) and first in blocks (four), though it was 22nd in yardage allowed (5,842) last season. This unit lost a lot of solid talent in the offseason (Bradley Roby, Brandon Marshall, Shaq Barrett, Shane Ray, Darian Stewart) but brought in defensive-minded coach Vic Fangio and improved its secondary with Bryce Callahan and Kareem Jackson. A potentially lethal pass rush led by Von Miller, Bradley Chubb and Derek Wolfe, as well as stud corner Chris Harris Jr. keeps this D/ST in the top-10 mix."
0.0,,,Darrell Henderson Jr.,-5.29,RB,88,LAR,5.29,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Rams traded up and selected Henderson in the third round of April's draft. A master in rushing efficiency, Henderson averaged an astounding 8.88 yards per carry on 130 attempts in 2017 before improving to 8.92 YPC on 214 carries in 2018. The Memphis product averaged 6.0 yards after contact per attempt last season, which is higher than the yards per carry of all but five of the backs who attended the combine. Henderson is small (5-foot-8, 208 pounds) but elusive and has decent speed (4.49 40-yard dash). Henderson likely won't have standalone fantasy value as long as Todd Gurley (even if he's scaled back a bit) is healthy, but he's certainly a very valuable handcuff, especially considering Gurley struggled through the latter part of last season with a knee injury. Henderson belongs on the bench in most leagues."

Burton failed to clear four targets in eight of his first 11 games. He posted a top-10 week in 25 percent of his outings (15th highest) and finished 30th or worse five times (including four straight during Weeks 11-14). Burton did score six touchdowns, but his 3.6 OTD and four end-zone targets suggest he was over his head in that department. On the plus side, Burton finished strong with a target share of at least 17 percent during each of the team's final four regular-season games. The 27-year-old is a TE2."

The 2015 first-round pick posted a 62/768/8 line during a breakout 2017 season, but his 5.0 OTD suggested touchdown regression to the mean was on tap. Sure enough, the Eagles slot receiver posted a similar 64/743/4 line in 2018 with touchdowns being the notable exception. Agholor still managed a 34th-place finish in fantasy points (he was 23rd in 2017), though half of his four weekly finishes better than 38th came in Weeks 16-17. The 26-year-old still has a role in a good Eagles offense, but he has a lot of competition for targets with DeSean Jackson and J.J. Arcega-Whiteside now in the fold and Dallas Goedert entering his second season. Agholor is fine bench depth, but not a weekly starter."

He ranked 11th in fantasy points per game. A closer look shows average or worse efficiency nearly across the board, including a 2.8 percent interception rate (11th worst). Trubisky has struggled with accuracy, as shown by his 20 percent off-target rate in 2017 (sixth worst) and 19 percent rate in 2018 (seventh worst). Trubisky's rushing ability and good supporting cast help his fantasy appeal, but he hasn't proven to be a good -- or even average -- starting quarterback yet. Consider him a midrange QB2."

His 50 extra-point attempts last season were fourth most in the league. His efficiency was lacking last season, as he missed five of 32 field goal attempts, despite an average distance of 36.2 yards (second lowest). Gostkowski is now 35 years old, but just signed a contract extension to remain the kicker for one of the league's top offenses. He's a solid starting option."

The 2017 first-round pick's snaps and targets increased substantially last season, which helped him to a ninth-place finish in fantasy points (he was 10th during Freddie Kitchen's eight games as offensive coordinator). A dangerous threat down the seam, Njoku has ranked top 11 at the position in aDOT in each of his two pro seasons. Last season's 16 percent target share figures to decrease slightly with Beckham in the fold, but it's possible Njoku overcomes that with an extra touchdown or two (he has exactly four in each of his two seasons). The 23-year-old is a fringe TE1 with upside."

The 2018 second-round pick underwhelmed as a rookie, but he was an explosive downfield playmaker at Oklahoma State and last preseason. With Antonio Brown gone, Washington will compete with Donte Moncrief and rookie Diontae Johnson for No. 2 duties opposite JuJu Smith-Schuster in an offense that set a franchise record for touchdowns last season. Washington, whose vertical role yielded a 16.2 aDOT on 37 targets last season, has WR2 upside if he's able to carve out an every-down role in his second season. He's a high-risk/high-reward prospect worth your attention in the middle rounds."

His rookie campaign was derailed by injuries, which limited the Texas Tech product to six games. Coutee played at least two-thirds of the snaps in five games. His target totals in those affairs were 15, 7, 5, 9 and 14, which works to a 10.0 per game average and a 28 percent team share. That's big time usage. Coutee is unlikely to score many touchdowns at 5-foot-10, 181 pounds, but his rookie-season usage suggests big things are on the way.

Cobb peaked with a 91/1287/12 line (WR8 in fantasy) in 2014, but his production has progressively dropped over the past four seasons. Injuries have been a problem throughout Cobb's career, as he has managed only two 16-game regular seasons and has missed 11 games over the past three seasons. Solely a short-area target, Cobb has ranked near the bottom of the league in aDOT in each of his eight seasons. He'll replace Cole Beasley in the slot in Dallas and doesn't figure to offer many big downfield plays or touchdowns. Likely fourth in line for targets, the 28-year-old Cobb is only worth a late-round flier."

Goedert was still on the field for a respectable 48 percent of the Eagles' offensive snaps but was limited to 2.7 targets per game and a 33-334-4 receiving line. He finished 20th in fantasy points but was 25th or worse in 10 of his 16 outings. The 24-year-old may see a slight boost in usage in 2019, but his ceiling is capped by the presence of Ertz, not to mention the acquisition of DeSean Jackson. Goedert has rare handcuff appeal for a tight end, however, and would be a TE1 lock in the event of an Ertz injury."

The 2018 third-overall pick struggled to a 58 percent completion percentage (third worst) and 6.9 yards per attempt (10th worst), though part of that can be attributed to a 9.4 aDOT (fourth highest). Working behind a weak offensive line, Darnold was pressured on 25 percent of his dropbacks (sixth most), took 30 sacks and missed three games with an injury. On the plus side, Darnold finished strong once healthy, posting six TDs and just one INT with a 7.4 YPA during his final four games. The youngster will have more help and a new coaching staff in 2019, so it's fair to expect another step forward. He's a back-end QB2 and breakout candidate."

Doyle missed 10 games due to a pair of injuries, but during the six games both he and Ebron were active, Doyle ran 151 routes and was targeted 33 times, compared to 101 routes and 22 targets for Ebron. Doyle posted a 26-245-2 line and was fantasy's No. 6 tight end during those six weeks. Sure-handed Doyle has ranked top five in catch rate each of the past five seasons, though he does nearly all of his damage in the short area (5.0 career aDOT). Doyle caught 80 passes in 15 games with Jacoby Brissett under center in 2017, so it's fair to expect that connection to pick up where it left off in 2019. Consider the 29-year-old Doyle a fringe TE1 in PPR and more of a TE2 in non-PPR."
-3.0,,,Redskins D/ST,-8.6,DST,24,WSH,5.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Washington defense ranked top-nine in interceptions (15), forced fumbles (19) and sacks (46) last season, but scoring one touchdown and ranking near mid-pack in yardage allowed (5,654) and points allowed (359) led them to a 16th-place finish in D/ST fantasy points. Landon Collins and first-round pick Montez Sweat are big-time additions, but gone are D.J. Swearinger, Ha-Ha Clinton-Dix, Preston Smith and Zach Brown, four of the team's top 10 defenders in snaps played last season. The likes of Josh Norman, Ryan Kerrigan, Daron Payne and Jonathan Allen supply this defense with some upside, but the Redskins have the look of a mediocre fantasy D/ST."
2.0,,,Will Dissly,-3.7199999999999998,TE,8,SEA,5.72,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Dissly took the fantasy landscape by storm last season, as the relatively unheralded rookie tight end exploded for a 6-147-2 line and the third-most fantasy points at the position through Week 2. Dissly predictably came back to earth a bit in Week 3 before suffering a season-ending knee injury in Week 4. The 2018 fourth-round pick was targeted 13 times through three weeks (third most on the team), though he ran a route on only 53 percent of the team's pass plays. Dissly figures to take on a larger role in his second season, which makes him a fine late flier, but Seattle's run-heavy offense will limit his upside."
0.0,,,Chris Herndon,0.0,TE,0,NYJ,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Jets selected Herndon in the fourth round of the 2018 draft and quickly put him in position for a big role. Herndon was on the field for 63 percent of New York's snaps, including 50 percent of pass plays. Following a slow start to the season, Herndon was fantasy's No. 9 tight end from Week 6 on. His 10.3 aDOT was fifth-highest at the position and helped him to a strong 9.0 YPT (10th). Herndon's 502 receiving yards rank 11th, his catch rate 10th, his YPT fifth and his aDOT third among rookie tight ends over the past 12 seasons. Herndon is in prime position for a second-year breakout, but will miss Weeks 1-4 due to suspension."

Kansas City allowed the ninth-most points (421) and second-most yardage (6,488) but ranked first in forced fumbles (23), first in sacks (52), second in D/ST touchdowns (five) and ninth in interceptions (15). Of course, both Justin Houston and Dee Ford were let go, and that star duo was responsible for 13 of the forced fumbles and 25 of the sacks. Frank Clark, Tyrann Mathieu, Alex Okafor, Darron Lee and Emmanuel Ogbah were added, but Houston and Ford were joined by fellow departures Eric Berry, Steven Nelson, Orlando Scandrick and Eric Murray. Tyreek Hill will add some value if he's on the roster (at least one return touchdown in each of his three NFL seasons), but this figures to be a weak D/ST option most weeks."

The future Hall of Famer's production has been inconsistent in recent seasons, as he's finished four of his past nine seasons as a top-five fantasy kicker, but 13th or worse the other five seasons. His production was better when Andrew Luck was under center, which hurts his cause in 2019. It's also fair to wonder if Vinatieri's play has slipped a bit, as he's converted only 85.3 percent of his field goal attempts over the past two seasons (he was at 90.7 percent the previous four seasons). Nonetheless, the 46-year-old is back for his 25th NFL season and is best-viewed as a starter only in 16-team leagues."
8.0,,,Giovani Bernard,0.8399999999999999,RB,57,CIN,7.16,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Bernard has been one of the league's best receiving backs since he entered the league in 2013, but his role has diminished in recent seasons as a result of injuries (10 missed games the past three seasons) and the emergence of workhorse Joe Mixon. Bernard posted career-low marks in both carries (56) and receptions (35) last season. His 4.7 YPT was second-worst at the position and marks the first time in six seasons that he didn't finish top-20 in the category. Undersized and uninvolved near the goal line, Bernard hasn't cleared four touchdowns in a season since 2014. He is no more than a backup who steals some passing-down work from Mixon. His primary value is as a handcuff."
1.0,,,Browns D/ST,-6.1,DST,26,CLE,7.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Cleveland's D/ST finished 2018 25th in fantasy points, which was an improvement on the previous three seasons. Although 25th doesn't sound good, it doesn't tell the whole picture. Cleveland allowed 6,288 yards (third-most), surrendered 392 points (12th-most) and failed to score a non-offensive touchdown but intercepted 17 passes (fifth-most), forced 18 fumbles (sixth-most), posted 75 passes defensed (fifth-most) and had 101 tackles for loss (fifth-most). They ranked 28th in sack rate but added Olivier Vernon and Sheldon Richardson in the offseason. They join Myles Garrett, Denzel Ward, Joe Schobert and Greedy Williams to lead what is a solid but not flawless unit. Especially with a Week 1 home matchup against Tennessee on tap, Cleveland is an intriguing 2019 sleeper D/ST."

Humphries enjoyed a breakout 2018 in which he posted career-high marks in targets (105), receptions (76), receiving yards (816) and touchdowns (five). Humphries ranks 24th among wide receivers in receptions (192) over the past three seasons, but 65th in touchdown catches (8, 6.8 OTD) during the span. His role as a short-area target (6.2 aDOT in 2018) who is rarely used near the goal line (12 career end zone targets) has left Humphries without a single top-50 fantasy season in his four-year career. Humphries will be on the field plenty as Tennessee's slot receiver, but he's unlikely to see much work near the goal line and will also be limited by Tennessee's run-heavy scheme. He's a fringe flex option in deep PPR leagues."
4.0,,,Alexander Mattison,1.65,RB,55,MIN,2.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Looking to fill a need after the offseason departure of Latavius Murray, Minnesota selected Mattison with the No. 102 pick in April's draft. Mattison is a big, between-the-tackles back at 5-foot-11, 221 pounds, but also has good receiving and blocking chops. Mattison, who handled a whopping 302 carries at Boise State last season, lacks speed (4.67 YPC) and quickness, but has the size and skill set to settle in as a reliable backup. That's the role he'll play in 2019 as Dalvin Cook's handcuff."

The Miami product proved to be a big upgrade. Badgley was the Chargers' kicker for 10 games and ranked 10th in fantasy points during those weeks. He attempted only 16 field goals, but converted 15 (a single-season franchise-record 93.8 percent) and made 27 of 28 extra points. Badgley also connected on five of six attempts in the playoffs. The 23-year-old has brought some much-needed stability to the Chargers' kicking game and is a fringe starting option."
0.0,,,Kyle Rudolph,-8.18,TE,33,MIN,8.18,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Rudolph finished as fantasy's No. 7 scoring tight end last season and has now finished no lower than eighth over the past three seasons. Rudolph has finished in the top three at the position in snaps and no lower than ninth in receptions, touchdowns and end-zone targets during each of those three seasons. Rudolph was a bit of a letdown in the scoring department last season (four touchdowns, 5.4 OTD), though his 10 end-zone targets were the second-highest total of his career. The 29-year-old lacks the upside of many TE1 options - and could defer some targets to rookie Irv Smith Jr. - but he's a high-floor fringe starter."
0.0,,,Jalen Richard,-7.43,RB,74,OAK,7.43,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"After flashing on a grand total of 195 touches his first two NFL seasons, Richard finally earned an expanded role in Jon Gruden's first season at the helm. Richard was limited to a career-low 55 carries, but his 80 targets more than doubled his previous career high. He caught 85 percent of his targets (fourth-best) and finished top-eight at the position in yards per target (7.6) for the second season in a row. Although Oakland called pass on 81 percent of Richard's snaps, he averaged more than 4.7 YPC for the third consecutive season. Richard scored only one touchdown, his best weekly fantasy finish was 16th, and he's a candidate for a dip in targets after Oakland revamped at wide receiver. His role as a complement to Josh Jacobs is enough for flex value in deep PPR leagues."
14.0,,,Derek Carr,0.0600000000000005,QB,23,OAK,13.94,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Carr is entering his sixth NFL season and has yet to post a top-10 fantasy campaign. The 28-year-old appeared in all 16 games last season, but still managed a finish of just 18th thanks to a career-low 19 passing touchdowns. Granted he was conservative (career-low 6.9 aDOT), but Carr posted career-best marks in completion percentage (69 percent), off-target rate (10.1 percent) and yards per attempt (7.3), while throwing only 10 interceptions (1.8 percent rate). The off-target rate was best in the NFL. Carr's prospects are certainly improved in 2019 with the likes of Tyrell Williams, Ryan Grant and J.J. Nelson added to an overhauled receiving core. That supplies Carr with some deep sleeper appeal, but quarterback is deep and he offers little with his legs. He's a fringe QB2."

Moncrief has had an up-and-down and -- at times -- injury-plagued career since being drafted in the third round of the 2014 draft. Moncrief's best season came in 2015 in which he posted a 64/733/6 line and was fantasy's No. 36 scoring wideout. He missed 11 games over the next two seasons with Indianapolis before posting a 48/668/3 line in 16 games with Jacksonville last season. Moncrief has underwhelmed thus far in his career, but he has been more productive with Andrew Luck under center and he'll certainly get good quarterback play via Ben Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh. Playing time is there for the taking with the depth chart wide open behind JuJu Smith-Schuster. The 26-year-old is a very intriguing post-hype sleeper."
3.0,,,Dion Lewis,-3.91,RB,66,TEN,6.91,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The Titans signed Lewis last offseason and gave him a legitimate opportunity to lead a backfield that included Derrick Henry. It didn't pan out. After averaging 5.0 YPC and a league-best 2.6 YAC in 2017, Lewis averaged 3.3 YPC and 2.0 YAC in 2018. He was more productive as a receiver, catching 59 passes (10th-most among backs) and pacing the position in catch rate (87 percent) for the second consecutive season. Lewis scored two touchdowns, and all four of his top-25 fantasy weeks came prior to Week 11. Following Henry's late-season breakout, Lewis is no more than a change-of-pace back and passing-down specialist. That gives the 28-year-old some deep-league appeal, but he isn't a viable starting option."

Fantasy's reigning No. 13 unit ranked top-10 in interceptions (15), forced fumbles (nine), tackles for loss (109) and points allowed (344). The Colts were 19th in sacks (38) but added one of the league's best edge rushers in Justin Houston during the offseason. He joins the likes of Darius Leonard, Malik Hooker and Jabaal Sheard in what is a solid, young defense. Consider this a fringe starting unit with upside, though a Week 1 road game against the Chargers makes the Colts less palatable as a draft selection."

The 2013 first-round pick has never appeared in a full 16-game regular season, managing to play only 43 (or 45 percent) of a possible 96 games. Eifert missed three games in 2015 but still led the league with 13 touchdowns. He missed eight games in 2016 but scored five touchdowns and ranked seventh at the position in fantasy points per game. In 2018, Eifert posted back-to-back top-seven fantasy weeks before going down with an ankle injury after four games. Eifert's durability is obviously a major concern, but the 28-year-old has enough upside to warrant a late-round flier in deeper leagues."

That's despite missing only two games in six seasons and despite having scored at least six touchdowns each of the past three seasons. Volume is the chief concern for Stills, as he's ranked higher than 56th at the position in targets once in his career (2017). Stills is a terrific deep threat (he's ranked top 13 in aDOT and Top 22 in YPR each of the past four seasons), but his role as a situational deep threat limits his fantasy upside. In fact, he managed only two weekly finishes better than 25th last season. Traded to Houston, Stills' playing time figures to take a dive with DeAndre Hopkins, Will Fuller and Keke Coutee in the mix."
20.0,,,Andy Dalton,6.25,QB,16,CIN,13.75,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Dalton threw 33 touchdowns and was fantasy's No. 6 scoring quarterback in 2013. Since that point, he's failed to clear 25 passing touchdowns in a season and hasn't finished a season better than 12th in fantasy points. That includes an injury-shortened 2018 campaign in which Dalton completed only 62 percent of his passes (ninth worst) and averaged 7.0 yards per attempt (10th worst). Dalton has posted exactly 99 rushing yards and zero touchdowns each of the past two seasons after rushing for 17 scores during the previous five seasons. Dalton is a below-average passer with a supporting cast that isn't much different than in 2018. Barring major contributions from new head coach Zac Taylor, Dalton is likely headed for another season of fantasy irrelevance."

Ross battled through injuries and fumbled on his only touch as a rookie before posting a bizarre 21/210/7 line on 58 targets in 2018. The 2017 ninth overall pick caught 36 percent of his targets and averaged 3.6 YPT, both of which were worst at the position. Granted, a league-high 36 percent of balls thrown his way were off target, but Ross averaged only 10.0 YPR despite a 13.9 aDOT (15th highest). He scored seven touchdowns, but his 4.8 OTD suggests that's unsustainable. Durability is a major concern for the 23-year-old, as he already has missed 16 games with various injuries. He could still turn the corner, but he's no more than a dynasty stash."

Roethlisberger, of course, is the primary reason for that. The now-37-year-old passer paced the NFL in dropbacks (712), attempts (675) and completions (452), while finishing top five in passing yards (5,086), passing touchdowns (34) and fantasy points (342) last season. Roethlisberger has finished eighth or better in fantasy points per game each of the past five seasons. Losing Brown can't be ignored, but Roethlisberger still has JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Conner and a strong offensive line at his disposal. He's a solid QB1 target."

The 2018 second-round pick caught seven touchdowns in 15 games, but saw his targets fall from 5.1 per game during Weeks 1-10 to 1.6 per game during Weeks 11-17. A hefty 26 percent of balls thrown his way were off target (14th highest), but he also struggled with drops (five). Miller's 13.0 percent touchdown rate (third highest) is unsustainable, but he's an obvious candidate for a larger target share in his second season.

His first year in Washington didn't go well, as he hurt his shoulder in Week 1 and then struggled to a 20/262/2 line in seven games before landing on injured reserve. The 2014 second-round pick has overcome a lot, having torn his ACL in both 2012 and during the 2014 playoffs before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury in 2015. Richardson is now healthy, still in his prime at age-27 and very well could lead Washington in targets. He's a fine late-round post-hype target."

The Toledo product will be counted on to help replace Antonio Brown, whom Pittsburgh traded to Oakland earlier in the offseason. Johnson is a small receiver (5-foot-10, 183 pounds) with good quickness, playmaking ability and post-catch skill (8.5 RAC in 2018). Johnson played both the slot (37 percent in 2018) and perimeter at Toledo, while contributing as a receiver (225 targets) and returner (79 kick, 17 punt) during his three seasons. His hands need work (seven drops last season) and he disappointed at the combine, especially in the 40-yard dash (4.53). Pittsburgh is terrific at developing wide receivers, so this is a good long-term landing spot for Johnson, but he figures to work as a situational receiver and returner in 2019."

Samuels impressed, rushing for 225 yards on 44 carries (5.1 YPC) and catching 19 of 21 targets for 145 yards. Despite scoring one touchdown, Samuels ranked 12th among backs in fantasy points during that span. Samuels is a terrific pass-catcher (his 87 percent catch rate was second-best at the position), who is expected to open 2018 as a change-of-pace and receiving back behind Conner.

Samuel is one of the most versatile weapons among this year's rookies. The South Carolina product can play inside and out and contributes as a receiver, rusher and kick returner. He has sufficient size (5-foot-11, 214 pounds) with strong hands, route-running ability and is terrific after the catch (9.7 RAC last season). Durability is a concern, as he has struggled with hamstring injuries during his career. Samuel figures to at least play in three-wide sets as a rookie and could push for more on what is a wide-open depth chart. He's worth a late-round flier."

He joins Corey Davis and Adam Humphries atop the depth chart. The Ole Miss product has good size (6-foot, 226 pounds) and dominates in the short-to-intermediate area and as a blocker (ideal in Tennessee's run-first offense). Brown is quick, has good hands, is productive after the catch and is a savvy route runner. He lacks top-end speed (4.49 40-yard dash), but that won't limit him much as he carves out a short-area, high-volume role in the NFL. It will be tough for Brown to carve out consistent fantasy value as a rookie, but he shouldn't struggle for snaps. He's no more than a late flier, but is a terrific dynasty target."

His 5.6 YPR was dead last at running back. Smith is positioned for a similar role in 2019, this time as a change-of-pace back behind Devonta Freeman.

Through three weeks, Ginn's 12/135/2 line was enough to allow him the 40th-most fantasy points at the position. He had been on the field for 74 percent of New Orleans' pass plays, which was his highest rate since 2009. Ginn led all wide receivers with a 77 percent catch rate in 2017. He's now 34 years old and second-year Tre'Quan Smith looms, but Ginn could push for flex production if he picks up where he left off in last season's playoffs as the No. 2 wide receiver in the Saints' high-scoring offense."

The defense includes a lot of talent, including Jamal Adams, Leonard Williams, Henry Anderson, Trumaine Johnson, C.J.

An intriguing pass-catching prospect, Knox essentially played wide receiver at Ole Miss, aligning in the slot on 80 percent of his 195 routes in 2018. Knox has terrific size (6-foot-4, 254 pounds) and athleticism, but isn't overly fast or quick. He was underutilized during his Ole Miss days, but was still highly efficient when targeted. He paced tight end prospects in YPR (18.9), aDOT (11.4) and first-down rate (80 percent) in 2018, while also averaging 8.7 yards after the catch (second best). Incredibly, Knox failed to catch a single touchdown in 22 games at Ole Miss. He may lead Bills tight ends in targets this season, but is unlikely to land on the fantasy radar."

Fant has a ways to go as a blocker and needs to cut down on drops, but he's a terrific receiver who will operate as an F/move tight end in the pros. Fant is 6-foot-4, 249 pounds and a terrific athlete with good speed and production near the end zone. He was tops at the position in the 40-yard-dash (4.50), vertical (39.5 inches), broad jump (127 inches), three cone (6.81) and 60-yard shuttle (11.49) at the combine.

Reed handled a hefty 23 percent target share (6.9 per game) during the 12 full games he played last season. That aligns exactly with his usage during the 2015-16 seasons and is just above where he was in five full games in 2017 (21 percent). Despite only scoring two touchdowns in Washington's mess of an offense, Reed was fantasy's No. 8 scoring tight end before going down with an injury in Week 14 last season. He'll again be ticketed for a huge role in 2019, though his durability remains a massive concern."

Harry is 6-foot-2, 228 pounds and is a strong, physical downfield weapon and good blocker. The Arizona State product is terrific with the ball in his hands and his size makes him a valuable resource near the goal line. Harry's speed (4.53 40-yard dash) and athletic limitations have led to struggles with separation, so he might be best suited for a big slot role in the pros. That makes him a fit in a Patriots offense that moves its receivers around quite often. Harry will begin his pro career on IR and will be hard-pressed to land consistent target volume behind Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon and perhaps Demaryius Thomas once he returns late in the season.

Wilson averaged 13.3 yards after the catch, which was second-best at the position. Miami's depth chart is wide open, which positions Wilson for a generous target share in an offense now led by Ryan Fitzpatrick and Josh Rosen.

After totaling seven targets in his first 10 games, Hamilton handled eight-plus targets during each of Denver's final four games spanning Weeks 14-17. Hamilton was fantasy's No. 22 WR during the span. He primarily lined up in the slot and worked as a short-area target (8.4 aDOT), which allowed a 67 percent catch rate, but only two touchdowns and an ugly 5.4 YPT.

Ballage was limited to 56 yards on 11 targets (5.1 YPT). The boom/bust production aligns with Ballage's profile, as he made the occasional big play at Arizona State, but his overall efficiency was about as poor as you'll find.

One of the league's fastest players, the track star ranked in the top 10 in aDOT in both 2016 and 2017. His 17.2 YPR in 2017 was fourth highest in the league. Goodwin has appeared in 16 games once and at least 13 games twice in his six-year NFL career.

He managed only one touchdown thanks to one end zone target and a 1.9 OTD. Snead's 1.1 touchdown rate was worst at the position and he has yet to eclipse four touchdowns in a single season in his career. Snead could soak up a decent target share in Baltimore this season, but the combination of the Ravens' extremely run-heavy offense, Lamar Jackson's inaccuracies and Snead's minimal role near the goal line leaves him with little fantasy appeal.

Harris actually found himself averaging a full yard more prior to initial contact than Jacobs, but forced tackles at a below-average rate and underwhelmed after contact (3.0 YAC). Harris lacks top-end speed (4.57 40-yard dash), but is a powerful, downhill runner with exceptional ball security (zero fumbles last season).

With Todd Gurley sidelined, Anderson paced all backs in fantasy points during Weeks 16-17. Anderson, who has ranked in the upper two-thirds at the position in YAC during four of his five NFL seasons, now joins the Lions, where he'll work alongside versatile Kerryon Johnson and rookie PJ Johnson.

Quinn is the in-house favorite to replace Jamison Crowder as Washington's slot receiver between Terry McLaurin and Paul Richardson.

Campbell, who checks in at 6-foot, 205 pounds, is extremely fast and athletic (receiver-best 4.31 40-yard dash and 4.03 short shuttle at the combine). The Ohio State product primarily worked from the slot (91 percent) last season and that's where he figures to align in Indianapolis, while also contributing as a rusher and kick returner (think Randall Cobb).

Smith has terrific speed (4.63 40-yard dash), which helped him to 16.1 yards per reception, including 8.5 after the catch, last season. He'll need time to develop -- and is well positioned to do that behind Rudolph in 2019 -- but figures to emerge as a viable fantasy option in the next few years. Smith has minimal 2019 fantasy value barring a Rudolph injury."

Brate's calling card has been touchdowns, as he's the only tight end who has scored at least six touchdowns each of the past three seasons. Brate was fantasy's No. 16 tight end during the six weeks O.J. Howard was out last season, which even puts a damper on his handcuff appeal. He has minimal fantasy value."

Arcega-Whiteside is a big (6-foot-2, 225 pounds), strong weapon who thrives on contested catches and jump balls, especially near the goal line (only two players eclipsed his 14 touchdown catches last season). The Stanford product lacks top-end speed and isn't particularly dynamic with the ball in his hands (4.1 RAC last season), but he makes up for it with tremendous ball skills and good hands (he dropped one of 75 catchable passes in 2018). With the aforementioned trio, as well as Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert in the mix for targets, Arcega-Whiteside will need an injury or two to enter the fantasy landscape in 2019.

The Notre Dame product was a huge winner at the combine, posting outstanding marks in the 40-yard dash (4.42), three-cone drill (6.77), short shuttle (4.07) and broad jump (140 inches). Boykin doesn't add much after the catch (3.8 RAC last season), but he'll quickly be able to step in as a perimeter deep threat opposite Brown, with Willie Snead manning the slot.

Granted his supporting cast was weak, but Rosen completed only 55 percent of his passes (second worst) and averaged 5.8 yards per attempt (third worst). He managed only two weekly fantasy finishes inside the top 20 and none were better than 14th. Rosen was infamously traded to Miami during the draft and will back up Ryan Fitzpatrick to open the 2019 season.

Lee finished top 35 among wideouts in targets in both 2016 and 2017, but had more drops (12) than touchdowns (six) during the span. In fact, Lee has registered a grand total of eight touchdown receptions in 53 NFL games. The 27-year-old is back near full health, but is no longer locked into every-down duties.

Calvin's brother is 6-foot-1, 199 pounds and profiles as a physical possession receiver. Ridley is a quality route runner with reliable hands and was productive near the goal line at Georgia. The former Bulldog lacks top-end speed (4.58 40-yard dash) and post-catch production (ugly 3.4 RAC last season), but he should make his name in the short-to-intermediate area, while adding value as a run blocker. He does not have a clear path to snaps in 2019 with Allen Robinson, Taylor Gabriel, Anthony Miller and perhaps Cordarrelle Patterson higher on the depth chart. Ridley is only worth a look in dynasty."

Crowell hasn't been quite as effective as a receiver, having failed to clear 200 receiving yards in four of his five seasons.

Wright quietly caught 43 passes for 447 yards last season while focusing his time on the short area (6.0 aDOT was second-lowest at the position and his 74% catch rate was sixth best).

Harmon is a big (6-foot-2, 221 pounds), physical perimeter receiver with good hands, ball skills and blocking ability. The N.C. State product is not particularly speedy (4.64 40-yard dash) or quick and was dreadful after the catch last season, posting a prospect-worst 3.1 RAC. Of course, he still caught 81 passes while working as both a vertical threat and reliable possession target.

This after the team drafted tight ends Jordan Akins and Jordan Thomas in 2018, which obviously means this depth chart is a bit crowded. Warring is a massive specimen at 6-foot-5, 252 pounds. The San Diego State product is a capable blocker and his combination of size, speed (4.67 40-yard dash), quickness, route-running ability and athleticism offers him big-time upside as a receiver. The small-handed former basketball star has struggled with drops (seven on 85 FBS targets) and post-catch production (prospect-worse 2.8 RAC last season), but makes sense as a developmental flier. He's likely to be buried on the depth chart in 2019."

He has a good combination of speed, hands and ball skills, which were highlighted by him hauling in all but one of his 26 catchable targets last season, as well as a solid combine showing (including a 4.71 40-yard dash). Like most rookie tight ends, expect Sample to play a situational role as a rookie. He has little fantasy value with Tyler Eifert and C.J. Uzomah ahead of him on the depth chart."
