Thanks, in part, to super-accurate Drew Brees, Thomas has posted a catch rate of at least 72 percent during each of his three NFL seasons.

Elliott's game reached a new level last season as he easily reached career highs in targets (94), receptions (77) and receiving yards (567). Elliott led all backs in touches (381) and was second in scrimmage yards (2,001). His underwhelming usage near the goal line remains a concern (his 10 carries inside the 5 ranked 17th last season).

Since missing his rookie season with a knee injury, Kelce has finished a season no lower than eighth at the position in receptions, no lower than sixth in receiving yards, no lower than 12th in touchdowns and no lower than ninth in yards per target. The three-time No. 1 fantasy tight end handled 26 percent of Kansas City's targets last season and should be in that range again in 2019.

Jackson averaged a massive 17.0 carries per game and ranked seventh in the entire NFL with 556 rushing yards during his seven starts. Jackson did, however, struggle as a passer. He completed 58 percent of his passes (fourth worst) and was off target on 22 percent of his throws (second worst). The Baltimore offense averaged 1.9 touchdowns per game during Jackson's starts, which would have ranked seventh worst over the full season.

The only area where Kittle was truly underwhelming was in the scoring department, as he managed only five touchdowns (5.8 OTD) and seven end-zone targets.

For the entire season, Chubb averaged 5.2 YPC (10th-highest at the position), including 2.41 after contact (seventh-best), and he averaged 0.53 fantasy points per snap, which was fourth-highest among backs.

Though, in his defense, Fournette has dealt with a large number of stacked boxes and horrific quarterback play. On the plus side, an extensive workload near the goal line (19 carries inside the 5 in 21 games) and good receiving efficiency (82 percent catch rate, 8.4 YPR) have helped him to two straight seasons finishing top-12 in fantasy points per game.

He paced all tight ends in snaps (949), routes (550) and targets (156), while ranking top-four in receiving yards (1,163), touchdowns (eight) and end-zone targets (nine) last season. After struggling in the area during his first four seasons, Ertz has scored exactly eight touchdowns in back-to-back seasons.

Despite playing a situational role most of the season, Henry's 238-yard, four-touchdown effort in Week 14 vaulted him into a larger role down the stretch. He was the top-scoring fantasy back by 17 points from that point on. Henry has been very efficient as a rusher (top-three in YAC each of the past two seasons) but has yet to clear 15 receptions in a season. He's expected to take on the largest role of his career in 2019, but that doesn't figure to mean much of an uptick in targets. That limits him to RB2 territory, but upgrade him in non-PPR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lutz has steadily improved his efficiency, improving from an 82.4 field goal conversion rate in 2016 to 86.1 percent in 2017 and 93.3 percent last season. The latter was fifth best in the league. The 24-year-old is one of the game's top kickers and works in the Saints' high-scoring offense. He's a solid starter in fantasy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Melvin Gordon,14.49,19.0,4.51,LAC,RB,23,"Gordon missed four games last season, but still finished top-10 among running backs in scrimmage yards, offensive touchdowns and fantasy points for the third consecutive season. Gordon maintained a substantial (albeit slightly reduced) share of the team's carries, and saw an uptick to 6.1 targets per game. That helped offset a bizarre drop in usage near the goal line; Gordon carried the ball inside the 5-yard line a total of 31 times during the 2016 and 2017 seasons but only four times in 2018. The goal-line usage is a concern, but Gordon is still in his prime at age 26 and is positioned for 300-plus touches in one of the league's better offenses. That, of course, assumes he reports to the team prior to Week 1. For now, Gordon is only worth a look in the fourth or fifth round.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His rushing efficiency took a giant step forward from that of his rookie season, as the 2017 second-round pick boosted his yards per carry from 3.5 to 4.9 and his YAC from 1.7 to 1.9. Mixon quietly ended up fourth at the position in rushing yards (1,168), sixth in both touches (280) and scrimmage yards (1,464), and 10th in fantasy points (243). The Bengals' offensive line remains a problem area, but 22-year-old Mixon is a workhorse back positioned well for another step forward in his third season. Consider him a fringe RB1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,Mark Andrews,11.85,23.0,11.15,BAL,TE,3,"Andrews was the second tight end drafted by Baltimore last season, but that didn't stop the Oklahoma product from producing one of the best seasons by a rookie tight end over the past decade. Andrews' 552 receiving yards rank sixth, and his 16.2 YPR, 10.0 YPT and 10.4 aDOT all rank second among rookie tight ends since 2007. Andrews did all that damage despite playing only 35 percent of the snaps. Andrews' future looks bright, but he'll need to find ways to stay on the field with 2018 first-round pick Hayden Hurst and re-signed blocker Nick Boyle also on the roster.

Though his play came back to earth a bit in 2018, Beckham ranked top 8 at the position in fantasy points per game for the fourth time in five seasons.

Cook has yet to emerge as a consistent fantasy threat, but did post the seventh-most fantasy points at the position after Week 12 last season, which aligned both with his return to full health and Minnesota's move to a run-first offense.

Ekeler is averaging 5.3 YPC (2.4 YAC) on 153 carries and 7.9 YPT on 86 targets in 30 career games. He ranked fourth in YAC last season and has finished top-six in YPR and YPT in both seasons. He has also ranked top-eight in fantasy points per snap both seasons.

In 2018, Brees finished outside the top 10 in pass attempts, completions and yards for the first time since at least 2009.

The 2014 fourth-round pick paced the position in fantasy points in 2015, finished sixth in 2016 and ranked ninth in the 13 weeks he was active and healthy in 2017. Freeman's efficiency has been good, but where he really stands out is volume near the goal line. He rushed for 29 touchdowns from 2015 to 2017, thanks to 41 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (second-most). He finished top-five in the category all three seasons and scored six touchdown receptions in that span.

During those 13 weeks, Conner put up 1,368 scrimmage yards and 13 touchdowns, which helped him to the fifth-most fantasy points among running backs. Conner's efficiency was solid and, unlike Bell, he benefited from getting many carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (15, third-most).

Although Lindsay's explosiveness can't be overlooked, there were some red flags. He benefited from 3.82 yards before contact per attempt (second-highest), averaged 1.58 after contact (14th-worst), averaged 5.0 yards per target (sixth-worst) and saw his YPC plummet to 2.6 in his final three games. It's possible that we've already seen Lindsay's ceiling, as he turns 25 years old this summer, but he is set for a significant role along with fellow second-year back Royce Freeman this season.

The Alabama product lacks top-end speed, but is quick, elusive and strong. Jacobs broke one tackle for every 6.1 touches last season, which was best among backs who attended the combine. Jacobs has the skill set to quickly step in as a three-down back in the pros and, aside from deferring some work to Jalen Richard in passing situations, he figures to play that full-time role right out of the gate.

That was indeed the case, as Mack's YPC jumped to 4.66 and allowed him 908 yards on 195 carries. Mack appears to be an effective NFL rusher, but he has yet to make much of an impact as a receiver.

10,Miles Sanders,0.0,0.0,0.0,PHI,RB,14,"The Eagles selected Sanders in the third round of April's draft. He joins fellow newcomer Jordan Howard atop the Philadelphia depth chart. Saquon Barkley's replacement at Penn State racked up 220 carries in 2018 and was one of the nation's most elusive backs, evading one tackler for every 6.4 touches. Sanders is shifty and agile, but not especially explosive and he's struggled with fumbles (five last season). Sanders checks in at 5-foot-11, 211 pounds and is a solid receiver and kick returner (which also fills a void for the Eagles). He had a very good combine, which was highlighted by a 4.49 40-yard dash and position-best 6.89 three cone. Sanders' shiftiness makes him a terrific complement to between-the-tackles bruiser Howard. Expect the two to split carries, with Howard the primary goal-line back and Sanders busier in passing situations. Sanders is a fringe top-25 fantasy back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Steelers D/ST,6.01,22.0,15.99,PIT,DST,2,"Believe it or not, the Steelers have led the NFL in sacks the past two seasons. They generated 52 last season to go with 99 tackles for loss (eighth-most) while allowing 5.3 yards per play (sixth-best) and blocking three kicks (second-most). Pittsburgh's D/ST salvaged an eighth-place fantasy season despite ranking 29th in forced turnovers (15), its lowest total since 2011 (15). Following minimal offseason turnover, Pittsburgh remains outstanding up front with T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, Stephon Tuitt and Javon Hargrave leading the way. The unit is suspect beyond that, though LB Devin Bush was scooped up in the first round of the draft, and Steven Nelson is an underrated addition at corner. This is a mid-pack D/ST option in 2019, though a Week 1 trip to New England hurts the draft appeal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has ranked above the 85th percentile in YPR four of the past five seasons. Hilton's main concern area is touchdowns, as he has never managed more than seven scores in a single season and hasn't caught more than six since 2014. Hilton has ranked outside the top 30 wide receivers in end zone targets during each of the past two seasons.

Only 13 backs scored more fantasy points. Most of Drake's damage was done as a receiver, as he ranked 13th at the position in targets (71), 14th in receiving yards (425) and ninth in aDOT (2.1). He registered only one carry inside the opponent's 5-yard line and posted a 3.9 OTD (which wasn't far off his 3.5 OTD when he scored four touchdowns in 2017). That suggests a dip in touchdowns is coming, though his role figures to expand with Gore no longer on the roster. Drake is a serviceable RB3/flex option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Montgomery figures to immediately play a significant role along with change-of-pace back Tarik Cohen. He is one of the biggest backs in this class (5-foot-10, 222 pounds). His on-field profile is very similar to Kareem Hunt's, as he lacks some speed (4.63 40-yard dash) and explosiveness, but makes up for it with a combination of power, balance and especially elusiveness. The Iowa State product evaded a tackle once for every 5.1 touches last season (second best in the class) and is also a good receiver and blocker. Montgomery is a potential workhorse and, though he'll defer a lot of targets to Cohen this season, Montgomery could push for 200-plus carries. Consider him a fringe RB2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite consistently ranking near the top of the league in these key categories, Brady has posted only two fantasy campaigns better than ninth during the past six campaigns. Limited by a switch to a run-heavy scheme, Brady was held to five top-10 fantasy weeks last season (his fewest in the past decade). Adding concern is the retirement of Rob Gronkowski, as the New England offense saw a large dip in touchdowns, passing yards, completion percentage and yards per attempt during the 29 games Gronkowski missed from 2010 to 2018.

In 2018, the Ravens allowed a league-low 4,687 yards, and their 287 points allowed ranked second-best. On the other hand, the unit ranked 22nd in forced turnovers and was outside the top 10 in sacks for the fourth consecutive season. The worst news is that Baltimore lost its Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7 snap-getters from 2018 (Eric Weddle, C.J. Mosley, Terrell Suggs, Za'Darius Smith).

However, when video surfaced of an off-field assault, Hunt was released by Kansas City and sat out the rest of the season. Hunt signed with Cleveland, though he will be suspended for the first eight games of 2019. Hunt is entering his age-24 season and has been one of the league's most effective backs over the past two seasons. He's averaging 4.8 YPC (2.5 YAC) on 453 attempts and an outstanding 8.4 YPT on 99 targets. Hunt will be an intriguing handcuff down the stretch, and he's talented enough to push Nick Chubb for touches, but it's hard to imagine a significant impact as long as Chubb is healthy.

The Oklahoma product is extremely undersized (5-foot-10, 207 pounds), but exceptionally efficient with his arm (he set an FBS record with an 11.6 YPA last season) and highly productive with his legs (1,001 rushing yards while averaging 7.2 YPC last season). There have been only three top-10 and six top-14 fantasy seasons by rookie quarterbacks over the past decade, but all who accomplished that did a lot of damage with their legs -- an area in which Murray will shine.

With all eyes on second-year John Ross, Boyd came out of nowhere to post a 75/1016/7 line and finish 17th among receivers in fantasy points despite missing two games. Boyd was only 11 behind A.J. Green in targets during the eight full games the two played together. His efficiency was also terrific (71 percent catch rate, 9.6 YPT), though touchdown sustainability is a real concern after he saw only four end zone targets and posted a 3.3 OTD.

The Florida Atlantic star ran for 22 touchdowns and ranked among the top backs in the class in broken tackle rate and evaded tackle rate in 2018.

Michel also racked up 12 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (seventh-most), which helped him accrue six rushing touchdowns. New England called run on an enormous 76 percent of Michel's snaps, which meant he was limited to 11 targets. That crushed his fantasy production, as he managed only five top-20 (two top-10) fantasy weeks. It's possible the 24-year-old plays a more versatile role in 2019, but his target share figures to increase only slightly with James White, Rex Burkhead and rookie Damien Harris in the mix.

Winston also rushed for a career-high 281 yards despite appearing in just 11 games. During the nine weeks he started, Winston ranked fourth in fantasy points. He continues to struggle with interceptions (58 in 56 career games), though part of that is a product of a propensity for attacking deep down field (he's ranked top five in aDOT in all four seasons).

Buffalo has ranked no lower than ninth in that department each of the past two seasons, and Carolina ranked top-10 in each of McDermott's final four seasons as that team's defensive coordinator (2013-16). If there is a weak spot, it is sacks, as Buffalo has ranked outside the top 25 in that area each of the past two seasons. The addition of first-round pick Ed Oliver aside, this defense barely changed in the offseason, which means a core led by Jerry Hughes, Tre'Davious White and second-year Tremaine Edmunds is back in place.

Allen carried the ball 89 times for 631 yards and 8 touchdowns and his 7.1 yards per carry topped the position.

Olsen's slump came after he ranked no lower than second at the position in snaps in five consecutive seasons, finishing each as a top-seven fantasy tight end. Olsen is expected back for Week 1 and should be no lower than third on the team in targets behind Christian McCaffrey and DJ Moore.

Cohen ranked top-six among backs in targets (91), receptions (71), receiving yards (725), touchdown catches (five), yards per target (8.0) and average depth of target (3.6). That helped overcome underwhelming rushing production. The undersized Cohen has ranked 71st and 70th among 72 qualified backs in YAC and has three total carries inside the 5 in his two NFL seasons. Cohen's role allowed him four top-six fantasy weeks, but also six finishes worse than 33rd.

He's entering his age-31 season in a much better offense, as he'll compete with Damien Williams and Darwin Thompson for lead back roles in Kansas City.

Westbrook averaged 5.6 yards after the catch last season, which was 13th best among wideouts. Jacksonville's abysmal quarterback situation limited him to one top 10 fantasy week, but the addition of Nick Foles figures to help his efficiency.

Peterson held down the fort, finishing fifth in the league with 251 carries and averaging 4.2 yards per carry. As usual, Peterson played a minimal role as a receiver (26 targets) but scored enough touchdowns (eight) to manage a 19th-place finish in fantasy points. Peterson re-signed with Washington, but with Guice healthy and ready to roll, the 2018 second-round pick will be the team's primary back.

Cousins was extremely conservative, posting a career-low 7.2 aDOT, which was sixth lowest in the NFL and led to an ugly 10.1 yards per completion (fourth lowest). Cousins rushed for at least three touchdowns during each of his three seasons as the Redskins' starter, but managed only one touchdown last season. He posted a healthy seven top-10 fantasy weeks, but finished 20th or worse six times.

Doyle missed 10 games due to a pair of injuries, but during the six games both he and Ebron were active, Doyle ran 151 routes and was targeted 33 times, compared to 101 routes and 22 targets for Ebron. Doyle posted a 26-245-2 line and was fantasy's No. 6 tight end during those six weeks. Sure-handed Doyle has ranked top five in catch rate each of the past five seasons, though he does nearly all of his damage in the short area (5.0 career aDOT). Doyle caught 80 passes in 15 games with Jacoby Brissett under center in 2017, so it's fair to expect that connection to pick up where it left off in 2019.

He has lived up to it, averaging 5.0 YPC on 258 career carries, including 5.3 YPC in 2018 (seventh-best). Breida stepped up his game as a receiver in 2018, catching 84 percent of his targets (fifth-best) and averaging 8.2 yards per target (third-best) on 32 targets. Breida is on the small side at 5-foot-11, 190 pounds, which has led to a limited role near the goal line (five rushing touchdowns and seven carries inside the 5 in his career). If there's a red flag here, it's Breida's poor post-contact production (career 1.62 YAC). Breida has been effective, but he'll need to share the 49er's backfield with Tevin Coleman in 2019.

Drops (eight last season) and durability (he suffered a Lisfranc injury prior to the draft) are red flags, but Brown has the skill set of DeSean Jackson and John Brown, which allows him plenty of upside. The biggest concern here is that Brown's short-term fantasy value will be hindered by Baltimore's extremely run-heavy offense and Lamar Jackson's shaky accuracy.

Rudolph was a bit of a letdown in the scoring department last season (four touchdowns, 5.4 OTD), though his 10 end-zone targets were the second-highest total of his career.

This unit lost a lot of solid talent in the offseason (Bradley Roby, Brandon Marshall, Shaq Barrett, Shane Ray, Darian Stewart) but brought in defensive-minded coach Vic Fangio and improved its secondary with Bryce Callahan and Kareem Jackson.

Despite the success, Johnson had career lows in carries (40) and targets (62) last season. Fantasy's No. 11 scoring back in 2017 plummeted to a career-worst 37th in 2018. A bounceback figures to be in the cards in 2019 as Johnson was traded to Houston where he'll play a major role following Lamar Miller's torn ACL.

Howard, who ranked sixth prior to the injury, accomplished the feat with low volume (4.7 targets per game) and elite efficiency (Howard has led the position in both YPT and YPR in both of his two NFL seasons). Howard has also scored touchdowns at an unsustainable rate (11 career TDs, 5.9 career OTD). The 24-year-old is clearly a rising star, but durability (eight missed games) and the presence of new coach Bruce Arians (his tight ends ranked 31st in fantasy points during five seasons in Arizona) are red flags.

Freeman averaged a pedestrian 4.0 YPC, but his 2.2 YAC ranked 14th at the position. Freeman struggled as a receiver, adding only 14 catches for 72 yards (3.4 YPT) on 21 targets. Lindsay's late-season struggles and Denver's new coaching staff are expeced to lead to a larger role for Freeman, but Lindsay won't completely disappear, and Freeman's receiving woes can't be ignored.

The 2017 fourth-round pick increased his rookie-season 3.6 YPC to 3.8 in 2018, but his YAC fell from 1.9 to 1.7. That is despite facing extremely light boxes both seasons. Williams has also ranked near the bottom of the position in catch rate (73 percent) on 71 career targets.

Primarily utilized as a sure-handed, short-area target who offers little after the catch, Witten finished 33rd at the position in fantasy points per snap. Of course, Witten led all tight ends with 897 snaps and, because volume is king, he managed a ninth-place finish in fantasy points. Witten is now 37 years old and expected to play more of a situational role in 2019. He hasn't posted a fantasy season better than ninth since 2013 and that's unlikely to change this season.

The unit was 10th in forced turnovers (26) and 11th in points allowed (347), though a league-high 14 fumble recoveries will be hard to repeat. Earl Thomas, Frank Clark and Justin Coleman were big offseason losses, though Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah will help offset those moves.

Head coach Freddie Kitchens took over as Cleveland's playcaller in Week 9 last season and Mayfield scored the 10th-most fantasy points among QBs from that point forward. During those eight games, Cleveland averaged 3.1 touchdowns per game (fifth most), 76 percent of which were passes (fifth highest). Mayfield adds little with his legs and needs to cut down on interceptions, which could limit his fantasy upside a bit, but entering his second season with Beckham, Jarvis Landry, David Njoku and Nick Chubb at his disposal, Mayfield can safely be considered a fringe QB1 with big upside.

The 24-year-old may see a slight boost in usage in 2019, but his ceiling is capped by the presence of Ertz, not to mention the acquisition of DeSean Jackson. Goedert has rare handcuff appeal for a tight end, however, and would be a TE1 lock in the event of an Ertz injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fantasy's reigning No. 13 unit ranked top-10 in interceptions (15), forced fumbles (nine), tackles for loss (109) and points allowed (344). The Colts were 19th in sacks (38) but added one of the league's best edge rushers in Justin Houston during the offseason.

Samuels played 54 snaps off the bench during Weeks 1-13, but James Conner's injury forced him into lead back duties during the team's final four games. Samuels impressed, rushing for 225 yards on 44 carries (5.1 YPC) and catching 19 of 21 targets for 145 yards. Despite scoring one touchdown, Samuels ranked 12th among backs in fantasy points during that span. Samuels is a terrific pass-catcher (his 87 percent catch rate was second-best at the position), who is expected to open 2018 as a change-of-pace and receiving back behind Conner.

Adding Robert Quinn helps offset the loss of David Irving and likely Randy Gregory on the defensive line. This unit is not without holes but has plenty of star power in the forms of DeMarcus Lawrence, Jaylon Smith, Leighton Vander Esch, Sean Lee and Byron Jones, who supply some upside. The Dallas D/ST is a streaming option when the matchup is right, and that will be the case Weeks 1-3 (Giants, Redskins, Dolphins).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the plus side, the unit ranked eighth with 44 sacks, which marks the Packers' seventh top-10 finish in the category the past nine seasons. Muhammad Wilkerson and Nick Perry (both barely played last season), as well as Clay Matthews, are gone, but Adrian Amos, Preston Smith, Za'Darius Smith, Rashan Gary and Darnell Savage were key offseason additions.

Johnson averaged 5.4 YPC (fifth-best) and caught 84 percent (seventh-best) of his 38 targets. Johnson will defer some touches to C.J. Anderson and PJ Johnson this season, but his averages of 12.5 carries and 4.0 targets per game after Week 1 last season will suffice to allow him RB2 production.

He was limited to two top-10 fantasy weeks, and 24 percent of his 49 targets were not catchable (second-highest).

Barber went on to rack up 234 carries (ninth-most), but failed to impress, averaging a career-low 3.7 YPC (1.9 YAC). Despite ranking 10th at the position in snaps (583), Barber was targeted only 28 times. He turned those looks into 20 catches for 92 yards (3.3 YPT).

Solely a short-area target, Cobb has ranked near the bottom of the league in aDOT in each of his eight seasons.

The off-target rate was best in the NFL. Carr's prospects are certainly improved in 2019 with the likes of Tyrell Williams, Ryan Grant and J.J. Nelson added to an overhauled receiving core.

On the plus side, Darnold finished strong once healthy, posting six TDs and just one INT with a 7.4 YPA during his final four games.

Brate's calling card has been touchdowns, as he's the only tight end who has scored at least six touchdowns each of the past three seasons.

Knox has terrific size (6-foot-4, 254 pounds) and athleticism, but isn't overly fast or quick. He was underutilized during his Ole Miss days, but was still highly efficient when targeted. He paced tight end prospects in YPR (18.9), aDOT (11.4) and first-down rate (80 percent) in 2018, while also averaging 8.7 yards after the catch (second best).

Haskins offers very little as a rusher (108 rushing yards in 14 career starts, 5.04 40-yard dash), which means he will need to do his heavy lifting in fantasy with his arm.

Campbell, who checks in at 6-foot, 205 pounds, is extremely fast and athletic (receiver-best 4.31 40-yard dash and 4.03 short shuttle at the combine). The Ohio State product primarily worked from the slot (91 percent) last season and that's where he figures to align in Indianapolis, while also contributing as a rusher and kick returner (think Randall Cobb).

Harris actually found himself averaging a full yard more prior to initial contact than Jacobs, but forced tackles at a below-average rate and underwhelmed after contact (3.0 YAC). Harris lacks top-end speed (4.57 40-yard dash), but is a powerful, downhill runner with exceptional ball security (zero fumbles last season).

Hurst is an obvious candidate for a leap forward in his second NFL season, but he was outplayed by fellow second-year TE Mark Andrews in 2018, and Baltimore signed Nick Boyle to an extension to play a big role as a blocker.

Uzomah was out-targeted 15-to-7 by Eifert during the three games the two played together in full last season. Of course, Eifert has missed at least eight games four of the past five seasons, so Uzomah could sneak back into TE2 territory if Eifert goes down again.

10,Kahale Warring,0.0,0.0,0.0,HOU,TE,0,"Houston selected Warring in the third round of April's draft. This after the team drafted tight ends Jordan Akins and Jordan Thomas in 2018, which obviously means this depth chart is a bit crowded. Warring is a massive specimen at 6-foot-5, 252 pounds. The San Diego State product is a capable blocker and his combination of size, speed (4.67 40-yard dash), quickness, route-running ability and athleticism offers him big-time upside as a receiver. The small-handed former basketball star has struggled with drops (seven on 85 FBS targets) and post-catch production (prospect-worse 2.8 RAC last season), but makes sense as a developmental flier. He's likely to be buried on the depth chart in 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
