He finished 10th among backs in rushing attempts (219) and was first in targets (124), receptions (107) and receiving yards (867). McCaffrey had at least five receiving touchdowns for the second year in a row. He improved his yards per carry from 3.7 to 5.0 and his catch rate from 73 percent to 86 percent.

Thanks, in part, to super-accurate Drew Brees, Thomas has posted a catch rate of at least 72 percent during each of his three NFL seasons.

Elliott's game reached a new level last season as he easily reached career highs in targets (94), receptions (77) and receiving yards (567). Elliott led all backs in touches (381) and was second in scrimmage yards (2,001). His underwhelming usage near the goal line remains a concern (his 10 carries inside the 5 ranked 17th last season).

Since missing his rookie season with a knee injury, Kelce has finished a season no lower than eighth at the position in receptions, no lower than sixth in receiving yards, no lower than 12th in touchdowns and no lower than ninth in yards per target. The three-time No. 1 fantasy tight end handled 26 percent of Kansas City's targets last season and should be in that range again in 2019.

Mahomes paced the league in passing touchdowns (50) and was second in passing yards (5,097), while adding 272 yards and two scores rushing. Entering his third season, Mahomes looks like the next great NFL quarterback -- and should be the top QB off the board in all drafts -- but history suggests we should expect a substantial statistical dip.

Jackson averaged a massive 17.0 carries per game and ranked seventh in the entire NFL with 556 rushing yards during his seven starts. Jackson did, however, struggle as a passer. He completed 58 percent of his passes (fourth worst) and was off target on 22 percent of his throws (second worst). The Baltimore offense averaged 1.9 touchdowns per game during Jackson's starts, which would have ranked seventh worst over the full season.

The Iowa product also ranked first at the position RAC (9.7) and was third in targets (136), receptions (88), fantasy points (259) and YPR (15.6). The only area where Kittle was truly underwhelming was in the scoring department, as he managed only five touchdowns (5.8 OTD) and seven end-zone targets.

He added 551 yards and five scores on 99 carries, all of which ranked third at the position.

For the entire season, Chubb averaged 5.2 YPC (10th-highest at the position), including 2.41 after contact (seventh-best), and he averaged 0.53 fantasy points per snap, which was fourth-highest among backs.

Though, in his defense, Fournette has dealt with a large number of stacked boxes and horrific quarterback play. On the plus side, an extensive workload near the goal line (19 carries inside the 5 in 21 games) and good receiving efficiency (82 percent catch rate, 8.4 YPR) have helped him to two straight seasons finishing top-12 in fantasy points per game.

Despite playing only 51 percent of the snaps, Jones posted a trio of top-10 fantasy weeks and ranked 13th at the position in fantasy points during the 11 weeks in which he wasn't out or injured last season.

Carson averaged 2.29 yards after contact (11th-best) and, though he played a minimal role as a receiver, caught all but three of his 23 targets. Seattle's run-heavy scheme will be back in 2019, and Carson's terrific second season gives him the leg up on Penny for the bulk of the backfield touches.

9,Melvin Gordon,10.84,25.0,14.16,LAC,RB,23,"Gordon missed four games last season, but still finished top-10 among running backs in scrimmage yards, offensive touchdowns and fantasy points for the third consecutive season. Gordon maintained a substantial (albeit slightly reduced) share of the team's carries, and saw an uptick to 6.1 targets per game. That helped offset a bizarre drop in usage near the goal line; Gordon carried the ball inside the 5-yard line a total of 31 times during the 2016 and 2017 seasons but only four times in 2018. The goal-line usage is a concern, but Gordon is still in his prime at age 26 and is positioned for 300-plus touches in one of the league's better offenses. That, of course, assumes he reports to the team prior to Week 1. For now, Gordon is only worth a look in the fourth or fifth round.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mixon quietly ended up fourth at the position in rushing yards (1,168), sixth in both touches (280) and scrimmage yards (1,464), and 10th in fantasy points (243).

Andrews did all that damage despite playing only 35 percent of the snaps. Andrews' future looks bright, but he'll need to find ways to stay on the field with 2018 first-round pick Hayden Hurst and re-signed blocker Nick Boyle also on the roster.

Cook has yet to emerge as a consistent fantasy threat, but did post the seventh-most fantasy points at the position after Week 12 last season, which aligned both with his return to full health and Minnesota's move to a run-first offense.

Ekeler is averaging 5.3 YPC (2.4 YAC) on 153 carries and 7.9 YPT on 86 targets in 30 career games. He ranked fourth in YAC last season and has finished top-six in YPR and YPT in both seasons. He has also ranked top-eight in fantasy points per snap both seasons.

In 2018, Brees finished outside the top 10 in pass attempts, completions and yards for the first time since at least 2009.

Prescott was limited by 56 sacks last season (second most), but the return of center Travis Frederick should help cut that number down.

Freeman's efficiency has been good, but where he really stands out is volume near the goal line. He rushed for 29 touchdowns from 2015 to 2017, thanks to 41 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (second-most). He finished top-five in the category all three seasons and scored six touchdown receptions in that span.

During those 13 weeks, Conner put up 1,368 scrimmage yards and 13 touchdowns, which helped him to the fifth-most fantasy points among running backs. Conner's efficiency was solid and, unlike Bell, he benefited from getting many carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (15, third-most).

The latter supplies some promise as Robinson is still only 25 and enters 2019 with a full season under his belt after missing all but three snaps in 2017 because of a torn ACL.

Henry missed three games during his first two seasons while also being limited by the presence of Antonio Gates. The 2016 second-round pick was on the verge of a 2018 promotion and likely breakout, but a torn ACL cost him the entire regular season (he did return and play 13 snaps in the playoffs). Henry has posted a career 81-1,057-12 line with 20 end-zone targets in 29 games. His efficiency has been terrific (70 percent catch rate, 9.3 YPT), and he's still only 24 years old.

It didn't take him long to become one of the league's most explosive playmakers. Lindsay averaged 5.4 YPC (sixth-highest) on 192 attempts and finished 13th among backs in fantasy points. Although Lindsay's explosiveness can't be overlooked, there were some red flags. He benefited from 3.82 yards before contact per attempt (second-highest), averaged 1.58 after contact (14th-worst), averaged 5.0 yards per target (sixth-worst) and saw his YPC plummet to 2.6 in his final three games. It's possible that we've already seen Lindsay's ceiling, as he turns 25 years old this summer, but he is set for a significant role along with fellow second-year back Royce Freeman this season.

Hooper ranked top five at the position in routes (474) and receptions (71). His 82 percent catch rate was second best among tight ends after he ranked fourth in the category in 2017. Hooper's primary drawback has been a lack of scoring, as he's yet to clear four touchdowns or five end-zone targets in a season.

Jacobs has a solid frame (5-foot-10, 220 pounds) and is a terrific rusher, good receiver and even offers value as a kick returner. The Alabama product lacks top-end speed, but is quick, elusive and strong. Jacobs broke one tackle for every 6.1 touches last season, which was best among backs who attended the combine. Jacobs has the skill set to quickly step in as a three-down back in the pros and, aside from deferring some work to Jalen Richard in passing situations, he figures to play that full-time role right out of the gate.

That was indeed the case, as Mack's YPC jumped to 4.66 and allowed him 908 yards on 195 carries. Mack appears to be an effective NFL rusher, but he has yet to make much of an impact as a receiver.

He posted career-high marks in each of those categories in 2018, as well as carries (94) and yards per carry (4.5). White was fantasy's No. 6 scoring back through Week 9 last season, but his usage dropped when Sony Michel and Rex Burkhead were active, and he ranked 27th from Week 10 on.

Cook's usage has been incredibly consistent, as he's averaged target shares between 16 and 18 percent each of the past seven seasons.

He had a very good combine, which was highlighted by a 4.49 40-yard dash and position-best 6.89 three cone. Sanders' shiftiness makes him a terrific complement to between-the-tackles bruiser Howard. Expect the two to split carries, with Howard the primary goal-line back and Sanders busier in passing situations. Sanders is a fringe top-25 fantasy back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Steelers D/ST,6.57,19.0,12.43,PIT,DST,2,"Believe it or not, the Steelers have led the NFL in sacks the past two seasons. They generated 52 last season to go with 99 tackles for loss (eighth-most) while allowing 5.3 yards per play (sixth-best) and blocking three kicks (second-most). Pittsburgh's D/ST salvaged an eighth-place fantasy season despite ranking 29th in forced turnovers (15), its lowest total since 2011 (15). Following minimal offseason turnover, Pittsburgh remains outstanding up front with T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, Stephon Tuitt and Javon Hargrave leading the way. The unit is suspect beyond that, though LB Devin Bush was scooped up in the first round of the draft, and Steven Nelson is an underrated addition at corner. This is a mid-pack D/ST option in 2019, though a Week 1 trip to New England hurts the draft appeal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was limited to 178 routes in 11 games, which allowed for a 14/174/0 receiving line. He failed to find the end zone despite three end zone targets and caught only 42 percent of his 33 targets. It obviously wasn't a great start to Chark's career, but also nothing to overreact to. The team's quarterback situation has gone from terrible to Nick Foles, and Chark is still only 22 years old.

He has ranked above the 85th percentile in YPR four of the past five seasons. Hilton's main concern area is touchdowns, as he has never managed more than seven scores in a single season and hasn't caught more than six since 2014. Hilton has ranked outside the top 30 wide receivers in end zone targets during each of the past two seasons. Hilton's value takes a hit following Andrew Luck's retirement, especially considering he was held to four touchdowns and a 55 percent catch rate (both career lows) with Jacoby Brissett under center in 2017.

Only 13 backs scored more fantasy points. Most of Drake's damage was done as a receiver, as he ranked 13th at the position in targets (71), 14th in receiving yards (425) and ninth in aDOT (2.1). He registered only one carry inside the opponent's 5-yard line and posted a 3.9 OTD (which wasn't far off his 3.5 OTD when he scored four touchdowns in 2017). That suggests a dip in touchdowns is coming, though his role figures to expand with Gore no longer on the roster. Drake is a serviceable RB3/flex option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Montgomery figures to immediately play a significant role along with change-of-pace back Tarik Cohen. He is one of the biggest backs in this class (5-foot-10, 222 pounds). His on-field profile is very similar to Kareem Hunt's, as he lacks some speed (4.63 40-yard dash) and explosiveness, but makes up for it with a combination of power, balance and especially elusiveness. The Iowa State product evaded a tackle once for every 5.1 touches last season (second best in the class) and is also a good receiver and blocker. Montgomery is a potential workhorse and, though he'll defer a lot of targets to Cohen this season, Montgomery could push for 200-plus carries. Consider him a fringe RB2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite consistently ranking near the top of the league in these key categories, Brady has posted only two fantasy campaigns better than ninth during the past six campaigns. Limited by a switch to a run-heavy scheme, Brady was held to five top-10 fantasy weeks last season (his fewest in the past decade). Adding concern is the retirement of Rob Gronkowski, as the New England offense saw a large dip in touchdowns, passing yards, completion percentage and yards per attempt during the 29 games Gronkowski missed from 2010 to 2018. Brady is still an elite player, but New England's run-first offense limits him to QB2 territory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2018, the Ravens allowed a league-low 4,687 yards, and their 287 points allowed ranked second-best. On the other hand, the unit ranked 22nd in forced turnovers and was outside the top 10 in sacks for the fourth consecutive season. The worst news is that Baltimore lost its Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7 snap-getters from 2018 (Eric Weddle, C.J. Mosley, Terrell Suggs, Za'Darius Smith).

However, when video surfaced of an off-field assault, Hunt was released by Kansas City and sat out the rest of the season. Hunt signed with Cleveland, though he will be suspended for the first eight games of 2019. Hunt is entering his age-24 season and has been one of the league's most effective backs over the past two seasons. He's averaging 4.8 YPC (2.5 YAC) on 453 attempts and an outstanding 8.4 YPT on 99 targets. Hunt will be an intriguing handcuff down the stretch, and he's talented enough to push Nick Chubb for touches, but it's hard to imagine a significant impact as long as Chubb is healthy.

The Oklahoma product is extremely undersized (5-foot-10, 207 pounds), but exceptionally efficient with his arm (he set an FBS record with an 11.6 YPA last season) and highly productive with his legs (1,001 rushing yards while averaging 7.2 YPC last season). There have been only three top-10 and six top-14 fantasy seasons by rookie quarterbacks over the past decade, but all who accomplished that did a lot of damage with their legs -- an area in which Murray will shine. Rookies are always risks, but Murray's skill set and path to snaps means he should be viewed as a QB2 with QB1 upside. He's worth a late-round pick in your draft.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The former Pitt star's first two NFL seasons weren't particularly inspiring and he was even a healthy scratch at times in 2017. It's safe to say the light went on in 2018. With all eyes on second-year John Ross, Boyd came out of nowhere to post a 75/1016/7 line and finish 17th among receivers in fantasy points despite missing two games. Boyd was only 11 behind A.J. Green in targets during the eight full games the two played together. His efficiency was also terrific (71 percent catch rate, 9.6 YPT), though touchdown sustainability is a real concern after he saw only four end zone targets and posted a 3.3 OTD.

Singletary is very undersized (5-foot-7, 203 pounds) and lacks home run speed (4.66 40-yard dash), but makes up for that with toughness and elusiveness. The Florida Atlantic star ran for 22 touchdowns and ranked among the top backs in the class in broken tackle rate and evaded tackle rate in 2018.

A coaching change reversed his fortunes, however, and Parker re-signed through 2020. The 2015 first-round pick has not lived up to lofty expectations. He has yet to put together a full 16-game season, missing 11 games during his four seasons. He has scored nine touchdowns in 53 games and his best fantasy campaign was a 50th-place finish in 2016.

That helped the 2018 first-round pick to a top-15 finish in both carries (209) and rushing yards (931). Michel also racked up 12 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (seventh-most), which helped him accrue six rushing touchdowns. New England called run on an enormous 76 percent of Michel's snaps, which meant he was limited to 11 targets. That crushed his fantasy production, as he managed only five top-20 (two top-10) fantasy weeks. It's possible the 24-year-old plays a more versatile role in 2019, but his target share figures to increase only slightly with James White, Rex Burkhead and rookie Damien Harris in the mix.

Winston completed 65 percent of his passes and was off target on 16 percent of his attempts, both of which were career-best marks. Winston also rushed for a career-high 281 yards despite appearing in just 11 games. During the nine weeks he started, Winston ranked fourth in fantasy points. He continues to struggle with interceptions (58 in 56 career games), though part of that is a product of a propensity for attacking deep down field (he's ranked top five in aDOT in all four seasons).

Coach Sean McDermott has an incredible knack for creating turnovers. Buffalo has ranked no lower than ninth in that department each of the past two seasons, and Carolina ranked top-10 in each of McDermott's final four seasons as that team's defensive coordinator (2013-16). If there is a weak spot, it is sacks, as Buffalo has ranked outside the top 25 in that area each of the past two seasons. The addition of first-round pick Ed Oliver aside, this defense barely changed in the offseason, which means a core led by Jerry Hughes, Tre'Davious White and second-year Tremaine Edmunds is back in place.

Metcalf showed off his speed and size at the combine with a 4.33 40-yard dash and 27 bench reps, though he did raise major red flags by struggling in quickness events.

Incredibly, Zuerlein has produced 10-plus fantasy points in 18 of 27 games during Sean McVay's two seasons as head coach. The primary reason for the success has been volume.

On the plus side, Wentz finished top 15 in yards per attempt for the second season in a row and improved his completion rate from 60 to 70 percent (fourth best). Likely related to his ACL recovery but still notable, Wentz's rushing production plummeted (93 yards on 34 carries).

In fact, Coleman is one of only five players who have scored eight or more offensive touchdowns each of the past three seasons. He found pay dirt 11 times in 2016, when current 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan was the Falcons' OC.

His 6.5 yards per attempt was fourth worst despite a league-high 11.2 aDOT. The surprising aspect was Allen's elite rushing production. Allen carried the ball 89 times for 631 yards and 8 touchdowns and his 7.1 yards per carry topped the position.

The Ole Miss product has good size (6-foot, 226 pounds) and dominates in the short-to-intermediate area and as a blocker (ideal in Tennessee's run-first offense). Brown is quick, has good hands, is productive after the catch and is a savvy route runner. He lacks top-end speed (4.49 40-yard dash), but that won't limit him much as he carves out a short-area, high-volume role in the NFL.

Olsen's slump came after he ranked no lower than second at the position in snaps in five consecutive seasons, finishing each as a top-seven fantasy tight end. Olsen is expected back for Week 1 and should be no lower than third on the team in targets behind Christian McCaffrey and DJ Moore.

Cohen ranked top-six among backs in targets (91), receptions (71), receiving yards (725), touchdown catches (five), yards per target (8.0) and average depth of target (3.6). That helped overcome underwhelming rushing production. The undersized Cohen has ranked 71st and 70th among 72 qualified backs in YAC and has three total carries inside the 5 in his two NFL seasons. Cohen's role allowed him four top-six fantasy weeks, but also six finishes worse than 33rd.

Peterson held down the fort, finishing fifth in the league with 251 carries and averaging 4.2 yards per carry. As usual, Peterson played a minimal role as a receiver (26 targets) but scored enough touchdowns (eight) to manage a 19th-place finish in fantasy points. Peterson re-signed with Washington, but with Guice healthy and ready to roll, the 2018 second-round pick will be the team's primary back.

Cousins was extremely conservative, posting a career-low 7.2 aDOT, which was sixth lowest in the NFL and led to an ugly 10.1 yards per completion (fourth lowest). Cousins rushed for at least three touchdowns during each of his three seasons as the Redskins' starter, but managed only one touchdown last season. He posted a healthy seven top-10 fantasy weeks, but finished 20th or worse six times. Minnesota is expected to operate a run-first offense this season, so Cousins is best viewed as a midrange QB2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Jack Doyle,8.44,11.0,2.5600000000000005,IND,TE,15,"Fellow tight end Eric Ebron stole the headlines last season, but it was Doyle, not Ebron,  who was (and still is) the Colts' No. 1 tight end. Doyle missed 10 games due to a pair of injuries, but during the six games both he and Ebron were active, Doyle ran 151 routes and was targeted 33 times, compared to 101 routes and 22 targets for Ebron. Doyle posted a 26-245-2 line and was fantasy's No. 6 tight end during those six weeks. Sure-handed Doyle has ranked top five in catch rate each of the past five seasons, though he does nearly all of his damage in the short area (5.0 career aDOT). Doyle caught 80 passes in 15 games with Jacoby Brissett under center in 2017, so it's fair to expect that connection to pick up where it left off in 2019. Consider the 29-year-old Doyle a fringe TE1 in PPR and more of a TE2 in non-PPR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Matt Breida,9.75,10.0,0.25,SF,RB,44,"Breida went undrafted in 2017 but received significant hype leading into his rookie season. He has lived up to it, averaging 5.0 YPC on 258 career carries, including 5.3 YPC in 2018 (seventh-best). Breida stepped up his game as a receiver in 2018, catching 84 percent of his targets (fifth-best) and averaging 8.2 yards per target (third-best) on 32 targets. Breida is on the small side at 5-foot-11, 190 pounds, which has led to a limited role near the goal line (five rushing touchdowns and seven carries inside the 5 in his career). If there's a red flag here, it's Breida's poor post-contact production (career 1.62 YAC). Breida has been effective, but he'll need to share the 49er's backfield with Tevin Coleman in 2019.

The former Oklahoma Sooner is extremely small (5-foot-9, 166 pounds), but he is superfast with the ability to get behind the defense and make plays with the ball in his hands. Drops (eight last season) and durability (he suffered a Lisfranc injury prior to the draft) are red flags, but Brown has the skill set of DeSean Jackson and John Brown, which allows him plenty of upside. The biggest concern here is that Brown's short-term fantasy value will be hindered by Baltimore's extremely run-heavy offense and Lamar Jackson's shaky accuracy.

Rudolph has finished in the top three at the position in snaps and no lower than ninth in receptions, touchdowns and end-zone targets during each of those three seasons. Rudolph was a bit of a letdown in the scoring department last season (four touchdowns, 5.4 OTD), though his 10 end-zone targets were the second-highest total of his career.

This unit lost a lot of solid talent in the offseason (Bradley Roby, Brandon Marshall, Shaq Barrett, Shane Ray, Darian Stewart) but brought in defensive-minded coach Vic Fangio and improved its secondary with Bryce Callahan and Kareem Jackson.

Despite the success, Johnson had career lows in carries (40) and targets (62) last season. Fantasy's No. 11 scoring back in 2017 plummeted to a career-worst 37th in 2018. A bounceback figures to be in the cards in 2019 as Johnson was traded to Houston where he'll play a major role following Lamar Miller's torn ACL. Johnson figures to be limited a bit as a rusher, but will certainly be very busy as Houston's primary receiving back. He's in the RB2 mix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,O.J. Howard,0.0,0.0,0.0,TB,TE,25,"Howard finished 2018 as the No. 14 scoring tight end, which is impressive when you consider he missed six games due to injury. Howard, who ranked sixth prior to the injury, accomplished the feat with low volume (4.7 targets per game) and elite efficiency (Howard has led the position in both YPT and YPR in both of his two NFL seasons). Howard has also scored touchdowns at an unsustainable rate (11 career TDs, 5.9 career OTD). The 24-year-old is clearly a rising star, but durability (eight missed games) and the presence of new coach Bruce Arians (his tight ends ranked 31st in fantasy points during five seasons in Arizona) are red flags. But Howard has played too well to be discounted. He has elite upside but will cost you a sixth round pick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Royce Freeman,11.98,2.0,-9.98,DEN,RB,34,"A third-round pick last season, Freeman looked well on his way to a terrific rookie campaign following an impressive preseason. Instead, fellow rookie Phillip Lindsay stole the spotlight, and Freeman was left running against stacked boxes (7.1 box defenders per carry was fourth-highest) in a situational role most of the season. Freeman averaged a pedestrian 4.0 YPC, but his 2.2 YAC ranked 14th at the position. Freeman struggled as a receiver, adding only 14 catches for 72 yards (3.4 YPT) on 21 targets. Lindsay's late-season struggles and Denver's new coaching staff are expeced to lead to a larger role for Freeman, but Lindsay won't completely disappear, and Freeman's receiving woes can't be ignored.

The 2017 fourth-round pick increased his rookie-season 3.6 YPC to 3.8 in 2018, but his YAC fell from 1.9 to 1.7. That is despite facing extremely light boxes both seasons. Williams has also ranked near the bottom of the position in catch rate (73 percent) on 71 career targets.

Primarily utilized as a sure-handed, short-area target who offers little after the catch, Witten finished 33rd at the position in fantasy points per snap. Of course, Witten led all tight ends with 897 snaps and, because volume is king, he managed a ninth-place finish in fantasy points. Witten is now 37 years old and expected to play more of a situational role in 2019. He hasn't posted a fantasy season better than ninth since 2013 and that's unlikely to change this season.

The unit was 10th in forced turnovers (26) and 11th in points allowed (347), though a league-high 14 fumble recoveries will be hard to repeat. Earl Thomas, Frank Clark and Justin Coleman were big offseason losses, though Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah will help offset those moves.

They didn't score a D/ST touchdown after managing at least five in each of the previous four seasons. The Eagles lost Jordan Hicks, Michael Bennett and Haloti Ngata but added Malik Jackson, Vinny Curry, Andrew Sendejo and Zach Brown in the offseason.

Head coach Freddie Kitchens took over as Cleveland's playcaller in Week 9 last season and Mayfield scored the 10th-most fantasy points among QBs from that point forward. During those eight games, Cleveland averaged 3.1 touchdowns per game (fifth most), 76 percent of which were passes (fifth highest). Mayfield adds little with his legs and needs to cut down on interceptions, which could limit his fantasy upside a bit, but entering his second season with Beckham, Jarvis Landry, David Njoku and Nick Chubb at his disposal, Mayfield can safely be considered a fringe QB1 with big upside.

He has sufficient size (5-foot-11, 214 pounds) with strong hands, route-running ability and is terrific after the catch (9.7 RAC last season). Durability is a concern, as he has struggled with hamstring injuries during his career.

They still showed well in yardage allowed (fifth) and points allowed (fourth), however, which salvaged a top-10 fantasy campaign. Malik Jackson's offseason release is notable, but 2018 first-round pick Taven Bryan is waiting in the wings and joins a terrific core led by Calais Campbell, Myles Jack, Jalen Ramsey, A.J.

Only three tight ends ran more routes, but Graham barely cracked the top 10 in targets (84), receptions (55) and receiving yards (636). The biggest culprit was touchdowns. Once a dominant force in the area, Graham was held to just two scores. On the plus side, his seven end-zone targets (eighth most) and 4.8 OTD suggest regression to the mean is on tap in 2019.

He finished 20th in fantasy points but was 25th or worse in 10 of his 16 outings. The 24-year-old may see a slight boost in usage in 2019, but his ceiling is capped by the presence of Ertz, not to mention the acquisition of DeSean Jackson.

Samuels played 54 snaps off the bench during Weeks 1-13, but James Conner's injury forced him into lead back duties during the team's final four games. Samuels impressed, rushing for 225 yards on 44 carries (5.1 YPC) and catching 19 of 21 targets for 145 yards. Despite scoring one touchdown, Samuels ranked 12th among backs in fantasy points during that span. Samuels is a terrific pass-catcher (his 87 percent catch rate was second-best at the position), who is expected to open 2018 as a change-of-pace and receiving back behind Conner. Samuels and rookie Benny Snell Jr. would handle backfield duties in the event of a Conner injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The perpetually mediocre unit finished 10th in forced fumbles (14), seventh in yards allowed (5,268) and sixth in points allowed (324) but was 26th in interceptions (nine) and 16th in sacks (39) while scoring only one touchdown. Adding Robert Quinn helps offset the loss of David Irving and likely Randy Gregory on the defensive line. This unit is not without holes but has plenty of star power in the forms of DeMarcus Lawrence, Jaylon Smith, Leighton Vander Esch, Sean Lee and Byron Jones, who supply some upside. The Dallas D/ST is a streaming option when the matchup is right, and that will be the case Weeks 1-3 (Giants, Redskins, Dolphins).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the plus side, the unit ranked eighth with 44 sacks, which marks the Packers' seventh top-10 finish in the category the past nine seasons. Muhammad Wilkerson and Nick Perry (both barely played last season), as well as Clay Matthews, are gone, but Adrian Amos, Preston Smith, Za'Darius Smith, Rashan Gary and Darnell Savage were key offseason additions.

He attempted only 16 field goals, but converted 15 (a single-season franchise-record 93.8 percent) and made 27 of 28 extra points. Badgley also connected on five of six attempts in the playoffs.

Johnson averaged 5.4 YPC (fifth-best) and caught 84 percent (seventh-best) of his 38 targets. Johnson will defer some touches to C.J. Anderson and PJ Johnson this season, but his averages of 12.5 carries and 4.0 targets per game after Week 1 last season will suffice to allow him RB2 production.

He was limited to two top-10 fantasy weeks, and 24 percent of his 49 targets were not catchable (second-highest).

Barber went on to rack up 234 carries (ninth-most), but failed to impress, averaging a career-low 3.7 YPC (1.9 YAC). Despite ranking 10th at the position in snaps (583), Barber was targeted only 28 times. He turned those looks into 20 catches for 92 yards (3.3 YPT). Barber finished five weeks better than 37th at the position in fantasy points.

Gordon was often utilized as a vertical threat (13.8 aDOT), which limited his volume a bit; during the nine full games he played, Gordon (63) was behind both Julian Edelman (83) and James White (70) in targets.

Granted he was conservative (career-low 6.9 aDOT), but Carr posted career-best marks in completion percentage (69 percent), off-target rate (10.1 percent) and yards per attempt (7.3), while throwing only 10 interceptions (1.8 percent rate). The off-target rate was best in the NFL. Carr's prospects are certainly improved in 2019 with the likes of Tyrell Williams, Ryan Grant and J.J. Nelson added to an overhauled receiving core.

Corey Liuget, Darius Philon and Jahleel Addae are notable offseason subtractions, but Thomas Davis and early-round picks Jerry Tillery and Nasir Adderley were huge additions at need spots.

Working behind a weak offensive line, Darnold was pressured on 25 percent of his dropbacks (sixth most), took 30 sacks and missed three games with an injury. On the plus side, Darnold finished strong once healthy, posting six TDs and just one INT with a 7.4 YPA during his final four games.

His production was better when Andrew Luck was under center, which hurts his cause in 2019. It's also fair to wonder if Vinatieri's play has slipped a bit, as he's converted only 85.3 percent of his field goal attempts over the past two seasons (he was at 90.7 percent the previous four seasons).

Brate's calling card has been touchdowns, as he's the only tight end who has scored at least six touchdowns each of the past three seasons.

Knox has terrific size (6-foot-4, 254 pounds) and athleticism, but isn't overly fast or quick. He was underutilized during his Ole Miss days, but was still highly efficient when targeted. He paced tight end prospects in YPR (18.9), aDOT (11.4) and first-down rate (80 percent) in 2018, while also averaging 8.7 yards after the catch (second best).

Haskins offers very little as a rusher (108 rushing yards in 14 career starts, 5.04 40-yard dash), which means he will need to do his heavy lifting in fantasy with his arm.

Harris actually found himself averaging a full yard more prior to initial contact than Jacobs, but forced tackles at a below-average rate and underwhelmed after contact (3.0 YAC). Harris lacks top-end speed (4.57 40-yard dash), but is a powerful, downhill runner with exceptional ball security (zero fumbles last season).

Uzomah was out-targeted 15-to-7 by Eifert during the three games the two played together in full last season.

9,Kahale Warring,0.0,0.0,0.0,HOU,TE,0,"Houston selected Warring in the third round of April's draft. This after the team drafted tight ends Jordan Akins and Jordan Thomas in 2018, which obviously means this depth chart is a bit crowded. Warring is a massive specimen at 6-foot-5, 252 pounds. The San Diego State product is a capable blocker and his combination of size, speed (4.67 40-yard dash), quickness, route-running ability and athleticism offers him big-time upside as a receiver. The small-handed former basketball star has struggled with drops (seven on 85 FBS targets) and post-catch production (prospect-worse 2.8 RAC last season), but makes sense as a developmental flier. He's likely to be buried on the depth chart in 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
